                    <p>I'm down to my last two modules before this quarter ends. the first
modules have been deployed and parallel-tested, with just a bit of flak
coming from "concerned" users (since they're sooo used to stand-alone
applications, they think that intranet applications would have the same
degree of difficulty, more or less). hell my scripts generate 5k lines
of values each for 10 different select elements and they wanted a more
"user-friendly" output. tsk. :P  </p>
<p>i posted a concern of mine on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ossa-ph/">Open Source Software Association -
Phils.</a> message board and got
this for an answer from one of "them".  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>first of all, let me iterate on few keypoints, branded computers like
the IBM/RS6000 is not TOY, and is not Cheap, for that reason it is
should be running critical applications, coz your paying for it, i
dont see a reason why should turn in into a frankenstein, i suggest
you focus on the problem at hand. linux and freebsd are fun to play
with, but it always been a common practice not to play on production
environment.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>my reply:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I agree that the RS6000 B50 is not a "TOY" as you call it. It has been
running several of our most critical applications since we acquired
it. These applications are to be ported to another machine in a month
(on an HP NetServer), which will leave the B50 unused. I am currently
running intranet applications on an old P3 machine and am offered to
use the B50 for these applications, which are very much critical as
far as we are concerned as the bulk of data entry and processing
occurs via intranet. Rest assured, we are not "Frankenstein-ing" boxes
here, as we all know the value of our machines. I'm just opening
myself to options; thus this research. Thanks for the suggestions
though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh well...some people seem more aghast when i go tell them that we have
an IBM server here, much more when i ask them if i could try and run
FreeBSD on it. they all think it's sacrilegious or sumthin. so blame me,
i'm finding a good use for it :P  </p>

onyks: just a thought, man. thought i'd let u and other open-source
advocates read this. :)

Mr. Richard Stallman in his article: [The Free Software Community After
20 Years: With great but incomplete success, what
now?](http://www.newsforge.com/software/04/01/05/1146229.shtml?tid=150&tid=82)
said, and i quote:  



> *"If you take as your goal the increased popularity of certain free
> software, if you seek to convince more people to use some free
> programs some of the time, you might think those non-free program are
> helpful contributions to that goal. It is hard to dispute the claim
> that their availability helps make GNU/Linux more popular. If the
> widespread use of GNU or Linux is the ultimate goal of our community,
> we should logically applaud all applications that run on it, whether
> free or not.  
>   
> But if our goal is freedom, that changes everything. Users cannot be
> free while using a non-free program. To free the citizens of
> cyberspace, we have to replace those non-free programs, not accept
> them. They are not contributions to our community, they are
> temptations to settle for continuing non-freedom."*

<p>great, huh? let's get that advocacy thingie started! :D</p>

                    <p>nuthin new...i still got sPrOcK up to my neck trying to fix wut went
wrong with the servers over the holidays. why do unwanted things have to
happen when nobody's in the office? :D  </p>
<p>happy three kings! whoopeee for Philippine politics! thanks to the
upcoming elections, my job is starting to sound like a lost cause or
sumthin. my wife's about done with her nursing anyway, but it'll be
another 2 years or so before she can go anywhere; unless some hospital
needs a nutritionist/dietician first, nurse second...then maybe, just
maybe...it'll be a lot earlier.  </p>
<p>can't get jakarta-tomcat-5.0.16 to cooperate with apache...or IIS. the
connectors i needed aren't coming off the racks as nightly builds
anymore. hahaaay...anyway, i wouldn't be advocating open source if i
didn't believe in it so...imma shut my trap now hehe...</p>

entries. meantime, imma wait till i finish archiving (nyek...parang
andami din noh?) my previous journals, which i will then delete for
closure.  </p>
