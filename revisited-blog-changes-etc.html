~~I've once more moved my blog. This time, it's on my own hosting
account and it's back to using WP~~. Same blog, different flavor now and
moving forward. I've had this short discussion with a co-leader in
church on going back to blogging, and he pointed out the importance of
identifying to a particular niche. I said sure, it's important, but I
think I wouldn't want to separate my technical gibberish from my
thoughts and reflections on God and Christianity.

So I was digging through old posts earlier, and in the spirit of moving,
migrations, or however you'd want to call it, I thought I'd re-share
with you an old [post](http://jon.doblados.net/personal/meh/ "Meh"):

<p>Be kind, now.</p>
