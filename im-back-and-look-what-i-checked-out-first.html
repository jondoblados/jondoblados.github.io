<p>This is how the rear of the NetBay rack in my previous company looks
like now. I headed back to CDO for Halloween vacation and was able to
drop by the office to pick up some of my personal stuff. They've slapped
in a Cisco router (where the yellow fibre cable hooks up to) and another
L3 switch. The old firewall appliance is still there, reliable as ever.
Cabling got more structured as well. Now that's what I'm talking about!</p>
<p>It's crazy, but when you've got a baby that you built for years and had
to leave one time or another, you get somewhat near it and it's the
first thing you look for!</p>
<p>So I'm proud of starting this and making things happen, and I'm proud of
the team that continued to make things happen. Hats off to Ian, Gayang,
Sherlabs, and Derf. You're all the best! Make them drool! :)</p>
