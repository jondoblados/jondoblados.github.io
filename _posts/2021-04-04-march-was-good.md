March was a good month. Not just because it's my birthday month, but I've been able to do more physical exercises as far as I'm allowed, and I've also been able to get through my first month back in the job.

For the first couple of weeks, I thought I was going to do 4 hours a day at most, and turn up the heat bit by bit until I'm able to do 100% again. But I suppose having to rest over a month does have its toll. It took significant effort to try not go all in with guns blazing on the first day back at work. LOL

Anyway, I'm trying something new this year. We've migrated our applications to a better platform, and we'd like to push that to the cloud this year. It'll obviously need a lot of liaising and cooperative work with other teams and domains so I'm going to do more engagement and solutioning than the usual engineering this time.

Last week, we did a platform-related hackathon and a critical refresh across clusters. There's going to be a lot more of these lined up, among others, and I'm quite excited with the prospect of getting them all done this year!

And oh, it's been 3 months since I removed the FB app from my phone. :)
