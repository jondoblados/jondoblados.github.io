Over a year ago, a friend invited me to take on a job in Singapore. Whenever I get asked about working overseas, I'd say I'd give it some thought. And almost always, I wouldn't give it any more than that, knowing that I wouldn't be able to bear being away from family over extended periods of time.

Fast forward today and I'm doing the OFW bit and all, with my family in tow! God really has this planned for me and my family, and all we needed to do was to take heed and obey!
