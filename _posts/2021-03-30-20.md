We couldn't be any more proud of her. She's been through a lot and though all that, she had her share of victories here and there, like getting her advanced diploma last year, and getting into University this year

You've come a long way, langga! Know that we will always be here to support you and your goals. Papa, Mama, and Miguel love you very much! ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
