In my previous employment, I didn't have any problems with submitting reports, practically because we used a time management/monitoring tool and the reports sort of generated by themselves. So when submitting daily reports isn't the norm here at the unit, quarterly reports become quite tricky.

I've resorted to referring to Google Calendar as most of the stuff we do are usually scheduled. I've also thought of logging everything on a text file and have pelican publish this to my website.

Meantime, my reading list for the day as I decide on a workflow that will allow multiple teams to work on the university website:
