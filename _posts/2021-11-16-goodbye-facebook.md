Meta specifically mentions accounts of politicians or candidates who may require additional protection during elections.

So the funny thing is that I’m no politician, and I barely even post about politics. I avoid doing so as much as I can, for my sanity’s sake, and well, for friendships' sake. I felt it was a strong-arm move to impose a seeming “need”.

It may look random, but I feel their algorithm checks my networks. Most likely, they’ve figured out that tons of my friends are uber active political analysts, whether self-proclaimed or not. Anyway to hell with their arm-twisting, no? I wasn’t going to give them what they want, primarily because they think they know what’s good for me, and because they didn’t bother offering an opt-out.

Some time in the afternoon of 12 Nov, I got locked out of Facebook and Messenger. Instagram seems to be working for me, and so is WhatsApp. I told my family and friends through Twitter, Telegram, and Signal that I wouldn’t be posting on Facebook anymore, nor would I be able to comment on any posts I’m tagged in. I think the best take away is that I managed to get my family to use Telegram instead of Messenger if they wanted to talk with us here in SG.

I was able to cross-post from Instagram yesterday, so I think I’ll be exploiting that option meantime. Am I going to enable the feature sometime in the future? No. No thanks, Meta!
