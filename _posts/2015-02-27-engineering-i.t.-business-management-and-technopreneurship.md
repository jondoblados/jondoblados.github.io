By 2016, five higher education institutes (HEIs) here in the Philippines will be integrating Technopreneurship as an offered elective for their Engineering programs. I am quite thankful that the higher education authorities have included my alma mater. More than being the center of trade in Northern Mindanao, the strategic location of our city makes it the best option for I.T. companies to build or expand in.

While the article specifically mentions [entrepeneurship training for future engineers](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/674790/setting-up-entrepreneurship-training-for-future-engineers#ixzz3Spg7ePjv) and that inclusion will be done in the Engineering curricula of 5 HEIs, I feel that this is severely limiting the beneficiaries (e.g. the graduates, and ultimately, the HEIs) of this inclusion.

The scope of Technopreneurship demands its inclusion not only in Engineering programs, but in Business Management (Business Administration, Financial Management, etc) and Computer Science (Information Management, Software Engineering, etc) as well.

On the other hand, I think these may just be preliminaries. After these initial inclusions, other relevant programs may be lined up for inclusion/integration. The higher education authorities will continue to leverage priority programs in Science, Technology, Engineering, Agriculture and Mathematics (STEAM), which are critical for the country's development.
