There was the 9-month long Enterprise Engineer Programme (EEP), of which I was part of cohort III. Then there was the Core Leadership Programme that had "The Apprentice" feels from start to finish! I wrote an appreciation post back in November 2022, [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jondoblados_aspire-inspire-execute-activity-6996494936883830784-xMel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGZVi0B31nOmD_zB3C9YsUQcfY9LVJBfOE).

Looking back, everyone was adjusting to post-covid work arrangements, not to mention team dynamics, which was literally "all over" the place/locations. My heart is still brimming with appreciation and thanks for these opportunities.

This year I'm doing a bit of recalibration and am putting on my student cap once more. I'm also going to start writing again, as I have not been able to do this anymore for quite a number of years already.
