                    </h2>

                    <p>A couple of months ago, I started attending this workshop/training for
leaders at Victory CDO. It's called Training for Victory (T4V), and it
was a once-a-week engagement for about 10 weeks; although it took longer
than that because of several holidays around that time. We graduated and
were commissioned, not as pastors, but as servants who will lead people
to take on a personal relationship with Christ. By God's grace, I was
also the recipient of the Award for Excellence during the ceremonies.  </p>
<p>All of the learnings I gained during the training has greatly guided me
in my walk with Jesus Christ today. You see, I've constantly struggled
with finding time for prayer, or for studying His Word. I've always had
some reason or excuse to do these at a later time. Eventually, I'd end
up not doing them anymore because work after all, takes a big chunk off
my day; and I have to spend the rest of the day for family and for
resting.  </p>
<p>But the Tuesday sessions brought back a discipline of study that I
thought I've lost. I've realized that just like with office work, or
with project "sprints", I can also discipline myself to do 10-15 minutes
of focused time for prayer, meditation, or Bible study.  </p>
<p>I've greatly benefited from this. Not only have I deepened my
relationship with Christ, but I have also begun to see and feel a change
in myself, in how I perceive prayer and what it can do for me and my
family, and in how I should conduct myself, whether I'm in the company
of others or family. There is no secret formula for this. If you want to
deepen your relationship with God and live a life of victory, let me
know. I'd be more than happy to talk about this with you (over coffee
perhaps?).  </p>

                    <p>Miguel and Isabel goofing off in front of the laptop. They discovered
the 4-shot option and started taking pictures by themselves.  </p>
<p>Please don't mind if I start posting more pictures here. I’ve really
been keeping myself from posting these to Facebook, which was the
natural tendency, no thanks to endless egging by the family. But no. 
It’s been a couple of years now that I’ve wanted to steer clear from FB
when it comes to posting pictures; especially of family. So yippykayay,
I'm posting here, and that's it! LOL  </p>

am home, and enjoying my second lease in life, one slow day at a time. I
have never been hospitalized for something as life-threatening as DHF
with complications before, so it's a bit frustrating that even when I'm
already out of the hospital, I could not move around as much as I want.
I could not even attempt to lift and carry my son when he feels like
asking me to hoist him up. I can only manage a few hours of work now and
what's more disheartening is knowing that I can no longer recoup a
week's worth of missed work. Well, that's how it is with us road
warriors/freelancers.  </p>
<p>But I am alive. I survived my first bout against DHF + pneumonia, and I
have God, family, and all the people He used to get to me, to thank
for.  </p>
<p>So I'm taking this moment to write and thank EVERYONE who reached out,
spread the word, contacted other people, prayed, donated blood, consoled
my wife, watched over me when everyone else was exhausted, and so much
more.  </p>
<p>You are all AWESOME and I know God sent you all to remind me that He is
POWERFUL and ABLE, and that if He wills it so, my recovery was just
there for the taking. I simply had to claim what He has already planned
for me.  </p>
<p>I may not be able to name everyone and if you're one of them, know that
deep in my heart I know you, and God knows you, and He will bless and
prosper you a hundred-fold because of your kindness.  </p>
<p>To <strong>Robert</strong>, <strong>Nadine</strong>, <strong>Alyssa</strong>, and all those who donated blood
and lent us their donor cards (<strong>Sherlabs</strong>, <strong>Ian</strong>, <strong>Ramil</strong>,
<strong>Justin</strong>, <strong>Joy</strong>, and <strong>Rogel</strong>), I will be forever indebted to you.
<strong>Emee</strong>,<strong> Jeanette</strong>,<strong>Jenipur</strong>,<strong>Butch</strong>, <strong>Romar</strong>, <strong>Marj</strong>,
<strong>Alma</strong>, <strong>Eugene</strong>, and <strong>Twinkle</strong>, you have been a great support
group. My wife wouldn't have derived as much strength had it not been
for your visits and help. To <strong>Sonny Boy</strong>, <strong>Rob</strong>, <strong>Mitch</strong>, and all
of Jenipur's friends who shared Mae's posts and helped spread the word,
thank you!  </p>
<p>To our life group, especially <strong>Ptr. Jones</strong> and <strong>Donna</strong>, who have
constantly prayed for us, thank you for visiting and for helping Mae
through her most trying times. <strong>Ptr. Janssen</strong> and everyone else who
prayed for me @VictoryCDO, thank you so much. <strong>Ptr. Babes Mendoza</strong>,
thank you po for being there on day 1 and for praying for me.  </p>
<p>To my kababata's, neighbors, and friends from back in LIDE, thank you
for all of your prayers. <strong>Plang</strong>, <strong>Julie</strong>, <strong>Micmac</strong>, and <strong>Tita
Jo</strong>, thank you for sharing Mae's posts and helping get the word around.
It's been many years since we left LIDE, yet it feels like we haven't
really left. It's amazing because you all still care very much. Thank
you for the overwhelming LIDEAN support!  </p>
<p>To Mae's friends from UP who shared her statuses and updates, thank you
so much for spreading the word. To <strong>EJ</strong>, <strong>Driq</strong>, <strong>Paul</strong>,
<strong>Joseph</strong>, <strong>Sherwin</strong>, <strong>Sunshine</strong>, <strong>Dulce</strong>, and all my friends in
Twitter, Shell-Matrix, and other online communities, you guys rock.
Thank you for your prayers and well-wishes. To my colleagues at work who
prayed for me and sent well-wishes, thank you so much!  </p>
<p>To <strong>Fely</strong>, my mother, thank you for flying to CDO and helping with
watch duty. Your presence helped Mae muster enough strength to keep
fighting for us. To my father, <strong>Lucilo</strong>, and brother, <strong>Jeffrey</strong>,
thank you for the calls and words of encouragement. To my father-in-law
<strong>Elben</strong>, thank you for making sure my needs are met and for rushing to
and from the blood bank, the hospital, and the house. To my
mother-in-law <strong>Juliet</strong>, thank you for making those important calls to
fellow doctors and for keeping the nurses on their toes by calling the
station often for updates and instructions. Special thanks to <strong>Dr.
Reuben Sedigo</strong> for checking on me twice each day. Those visits meant so
much to us. And most importantly, to my doctor/specialist, <strong>Dr. Gina
Akiat</strong>, who did so much for us and for always reassuring Mae that
things are going to be fine.  </p>
<p>And to my wife <strong>Mae</strong>, thank you for never leaving my side. I know you
said I should fight and that's what I'll do. I'll keep fighting for you
and our kids, and yes, I'll learn to stop and smell the flowers once in
a while. I love you so much!</p>

                    <p>Since we moved apartments, the little man started doing facial
expressions that always gets us wondering how he got them. I've tried
capturing these expressions with a camera but it's a lot harder than
simply having the phone or the point-and-shoot handy at all times.  </p>
<p>Well today was a treat. He fired up one facial expression, and let me
take a picture! Yay!  </p>
