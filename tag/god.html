                    </h2>

                    <p>Each year, on Valentine's day, I usually surprise my darling wife with a
letter/card, or a bouquet of roses. As it was a yearly thing, I knew she
sort of expected these surprises; she'd look surprised, but I knew she
wasn't really. Occasionally, she does get surprised. Like that time back
in Cebu when I bought her a rather intricate bouquet of flowers. Her
head spun when she found out how much I paid for it. Surprise!  </p>
<p>This year, however, is different. I was not able to prepare anything for her.
I didn't get her anything, thinking that I'd just make up for it with
dinner, or something. Yes, I didn't plan for this and I feel lousy
actually. Last night, after my daughter gave me and my wife her
home-made Valentine greeting cards, my wife started chiding me about
what I was going to give her the next day. I gave her my usual "I'm not
telling" smile and silently kicked myself. I wished I already had
something ready, and I found myself already longing for the anticipation
of the surprise's revelation.</p>
<p>Obviously, I've already fallen off the bus-called-state-of-preparedness, and my chances of springing a surprise
is not looking good. But during this morning's rush, my wife told me to
look at my backpack and I got a shock. Sticking out of the front pocket
was what clearly looked like greeting card. I pulled out the card from
its envelope, opened it, read what she wrote on it, looked at her, and
saw her give me that knowing smile. It was her turn to surprise
me.</p>
<p>I thank God for this experience. It reminds me that no matter the
circumstance, all things turn for good. Far from being a perfect
relationship, it is by faith that we've persisted in believing in God's
plans and promises for us. And ultimately, it is by His grace that we
were given this great relationship to enjoy. I was too concerned with
the fact that I did not have anything prepared for this day. God reminds
me that more than surprises, and more than how the world celebrates
Valentine's day, it is the relationships that He affords and blesses me
that I must nurture and be thankful for. <em>"The Lord is righteous in all
his ways and faithful in all he does" (Psalm 145:17).</em></p>
<p>How awesome it is to have Him who is all-faithful to back you up!</p>

~~I've once more moved my blog. This time, it's on my own hosting
account and it's back to using WP~~. Same blog, different flavor now and
moving forward. I've had this short discussion with a co-leader in
church on going back to blogging, and he pointed out the importance of
identifying to a particular niche. I said sure, it's important, but I
think I wouldn't want to separate my technical gibberish from my
thoughts and reflections on God and Christianity.

So I was digging through old posts earlier, and in the spirit of moving,
migrations, or however you'd want to call it, I thought I'd re-share
with you an old [post](http://jon.doblados.net/personal/meh/ "Meh"):

<p>Be kind, now.</p>

                    <p>A couple of months ago, I started attending this workshop/training for
leaders at Victory CDO. It's called Training for Victory (T4V), and it
was a once-a-week engagement for about 10 weeks; although it took longer
than that because of several holidays around that time. We graduated and
were commissioned, not as pastors, but as servants who will lead people
to take on a personal relationship with Christ. By God's grace, I was
also the recipient of the Award for Excellence during the ceremonies.  </p>
<p>All of the learnings I gained during the training has greatly guided me
in my walk with Jesus Christ today. You see, I've constantly struggled
with finding time for prayer, or for studying His Word. I've always had
some reason or excuse to do these at a later time. Eventually, I'd end
up not doing them anymore because work after all, takes a big chunk off
my day; and I have to spend the rest of the day for family and for
resting.  </p>
<p>But the Tuesday sessions brought back a discipline of study that I
thought I've lost. I've realized that just like with office work, or
with project "sprints", I can also discipline myself to do 10-15 minutes
of focused time for prayer, meditation, or Bible study.  </p>
<p>I've greatly benefited from this. Not only have I deepened my
relationship with Christ, but I have also begun to see and feel a change
in myself, in how I perceive prayer and what it can do for me and my
family, and in how I should conduct myself, whether I'm in the company
of others or family. There is no secret formula for this. If you want to
deepen your relationship with God and live a life of victory, let me
know. I'd be more than happy to talk about this with you (over coffee
perhaps?).  </p>
