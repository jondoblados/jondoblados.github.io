                    </h2>

                    <p>I was looking for a quick and painless way to determine what IP
addresses used our web app the most and stumbled across this excellent
<a href="http://encodable.com/tech/blog/2008/12/17/Count_IP_Addresses_in_Access_Log_File_BASH_OneLiner">post</a>. I
got reminded of the power of the command-line interface and that often,
I underestimate the way these commands are supposed to make a sysad's
life easier.</p>
<p>So here's a quick tip for counting unique visitors to your web app.
Locate your web app's log file and do a quick scan of the last few
lines. In my case, this is what I saw:</p>
<p><code>112.198.79.223 - - [10/Jul/2010:00:57:29 -0400] "POST /v2/api/execute.php?method=upload_time&amp;ver=win1.1.15 HTTP/1.1" 200 116 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"117.241.112.254 - - [10/Jul/2010:00:57:30 -0400] "POST /v2/api/execute.php?method=timestat&amp;ver=win1.1.15 HTTP/1.1" 200 288 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"80.249.84.105 - - [10/Jul/2010:00:57:29 -0400] "POST /v2/api/execute.php?method=offtime&amp;ver=win1.1.15 HTTP/1.1" 200 19 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"117.241.112.254 - - [10/Jul/2010:00:57:32 -0400] "POST /v2/api/execute.php?method=get_defaults&amp;ver=win1.1.15 HTTP/1.1" 200 77 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"</code></p>
<p>In this log format, the IP address appears first, so we will only need
to get the first set of characters, separated by a space. In order to
count instances of an IP address, we sort the IP addresses so similar IP
addresses are grouped together, then count them. Then we sort them again
so that the sums are arranged. The number of unique IPs may give you
pages of standard output, so optionally, if you only want to see which
IP addresses accessed the web app the most, we look at the top results
only.</p>
<p>So these are the commands used, piped one after the other, with the
output:</p>
<p><code>[root@server2 ~]# cat /var/log/httpd/access_ssl.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>71612 216.157.78.237 34094 120.28.205.244 30091 119.93.97.54 25078 120.28.214.104 18949 120.28.195.151 17929 58.107.64.40 14877 212.98.174.235 14752 117.241.112.143 14429 120.28.247.74 12864 117.241.113.183 [root@server2 ~]#</code></p>
<p>Happy counting, err reporting!</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>i've had this happen to me again the other week and as always, felt like
kicking myself for not remembering.</p>
<p>we do a lot of performance tuning on mysql, and as a result, we almost
always manage to get plesk mangled. not its fault, it just can't run
without mysql, doh.</p>
<p>not of preference, but plesk happens to be there to make handling
domains easier, as a single editing point when you want to change
something and not worry about missing something out.</p>
<p>so there's a custom /etc/my.cnf that we use, and with changes to limits
done (both on mysql and via ulimit), you'd think that a reload of mysqld
would do. (we use InnoDB btw)</p>
<p>normally, that's all you need to have mysqld read off the new settings.
if you've grown so dependent on plesk (like i have), you would not
notice that mysqld didn't actually start, and you will get an error when
you load plesk, thinking that it's a plesk error:</p>
<p><code>ERROR: PleskMainDBExceptionMySQL query failed: Incorrect information in file: './psa/misc.frm'</code></p>
<p>0: /usr/local/psa/admin/plib/common_func.php3:218<br />
db_query(string 'select param, val from misc')<br />
1: /usr/local/psa/admin/plib/common_func.php3:497<br />
get_param(string 'mysql41_compatible')<br />
2: /usr/local/psa/admin/plib/common_func.php3:394<br />
db_set_names()<br />
3: /usr/local/psa/admin/plib/common_func.php3:373<br />
db_connect_real(string 'localhost', string 'admin', string
'********', string 'psa')<br />
4: /usr/local/psa/admin/plib/common_func.php3:353<br />
db_connect()<br />
5: /usr/local/psa/admin/auto_prepend/auth.php3:82<br />
</code></p>
<p>even a restart of the plesk service will not work:</p>
<p><code>[root@jedi]# /etc/init.d/psa restartUnable to query parameter by query select val from misc where param='mysql41_compatible': Incorrect information in file: './psa/misc.frm'Unable to query parameter by query select val from misc where param='mysql41_compatible': Incorrect information in file: './psa/misc.frm'Mysql error: Incorrect information in file: './psa/key_history.frm'Processing config directory: /usr/local/psa/admin/conf/httpsd.*.includeSyntax OK/usr/local/psa/admin/bin/httpsdctl restart: httpd restartedERROR 1033 (HY000) at line 1: Incorrect information in file: './psa/sessions.frm'</code></p>
<p>so this is a mysqld failing to start properly problem. to fix this, go
to your mysql datadir and see if the sizes of your innodb log files
match those in your .cnf. we usually set innodb_log_file_size = 256M
and innodb_log_buffer_size = 256M in /etc/my.cnf.</p>
<p>if they don't match, stop mysqld, remove the ib_logfile0 and
ib_logfile1 files, and start mysqld. be careful not to delete the
ibdata1 or ibdata2 files or you lose your data. avoid using rm -r ib*
(yea, wildcards and fast fingers give sysads their most stupefying
moments)</p>
<p>innodb will recreate the log files to match your .cnf and mysqld now
becomes available for plesk.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Almost a month of downtime. The servers were fine, but our IP addresses
were not. Somehow, a system bug from one of the hosting companies caused
our plan to include 14 other IP addresses, and we only maintained 6 as
far as I am concerned.</p>
<p>So the hosting company eventually understood what was happening and
started asking the right questions. The bug is that the system allowed
network administrators to assign to new clients, the IP addresses that
have already been assigned to a current client.</p>
<p>We spent crazy hours figuring out what happened. Since the domains were
not loading our sites, and instead were redirecting to some domains we
don’t own (real bad sites btw), we checked if .htaccess was modified and
tested if it was working at all. I also did double checks on virtual
host configurations and they all looked clean.</p>
<p>I started thinking that it was a routing issue. We were not using the
publicly routable IPs for the virtual hosts; instead, we used internal
IPs as mapped to the firewall hardware. A lookup on the domain/s that we
were being redirected to reported different IP addresses, which didn’t
readily confirm my suspicions, but stressed the possibility of
IP-hijacking.</p>
<p>It’s not supposed to be taken in the context of BGP (border gateway
protocol), as this is beyond me. Instead, think of your assumption over
IP addresses that we’re using, to serve your websites. Sounds clear? I
hope it does. I got pretty lost myself and it isn’t after deep digging
at the hosting company’s end that their errors became apparent.</p>
<p>So in the light of this realization, I’ve already moved the domains to
some other hosting. Way too much work and way uncool.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Over a year ago, we had several servers configured for high traffic
websites. A mispartioning resulted in /var becoming obscenely small, and
it was only after MySQL crashed that we remembered this. We couldn’t
afford more downtime if we dealt with the partition size problem, so I
thought of quickly moving the data files into /home/mysql/{dbname} from
/var/lib/mysql/{dbname} and create the symlink /var/lib/mysql/{dbname}
-> /home/mysql/{dbname}.</p>
<p>I was not certain of the performance implications to this. I heard from
a fellow Linux junkie here that there may be a slight penalties in terms
of access speed, since /home was meant for generic read/write, whereas
/var was accessed in a very quick manner. Gotta verify this. But for
now, I dwell in the power of symbolic links.</p>
