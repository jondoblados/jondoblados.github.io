<p>The authors have sufficiently summarized the study by including the
purpose, methods, results, and conclusions or summary. The study was
focused on the discussion of the considerations and technology of a
created public web-based GIS service, which has already been deployed.
The abstract is not entirely written in the past tense.</p>
<p>The article doesnâ€™t have an introduction part, and instead presented a
background of the study. Although citations are made, the review of
literature was very minimal. There were no references to similar works
done in the area of study in this part of the study. References to
similar systems are done in the discussion of results part of the study.
The underlying concepts, especially on the importance of making data on
communicable diseases available to the public via internet, was only
mentioned and barely discussed.</p>
<p>There was no hypothesis or research question posted on the study. What
seemed to be the thrust of the study was the conjecture in that making
surveillance data available in the internet, especially to public health
officials, was key to policy-making, prioritization, and information
related activities.</p>
<p>The authors have presented data collection and processing procedures in
paragraph form. There was no further attempt to expound on the methods,
and there were no charts or figures to support the discussion of the
processing procedures. Likewise, the presentation of the hardware and
software configuration was done in passing.</p>
<p>The authors were able to present and discuss the results of their study
well. As their study was focused on the system, the basic application
design, the work or process flow, database structure, user interface,
and usage, were sufficiently presented. The discussion focused on the
design principles used, security, performance, and quality concerns.
There was mention of data interpretation, but this was for general
consumption and only applied for the locality. This part of the study
presented similar systems that already exist in other parts of the
world, using a short comparison of features, but not as in-depth as
necessary.</p>
<p>The authors made recommendations for improvements, and discussed
possible enhancements and/or changes in the system, the area of study,
and in the available technology.</p>
