<p>Casey Kasem&#8217;s American Top 40 broadcast back in April 1988 is being streamed today over XM Radio. Def Leppard&#8217;s Hysteria is currently playing. Measures and measures of this classic hit flood my ears and I can&#8217;t help but smile. There must have been thousands of Icehouse, Def Leppard, and Nelson (to name a few) playbacks since I got them cassette and 8-track tapes.</p><br/><p>I still think that the 1980&#8217;s was the best decade to grow in. All those crazy get-ups that now look fugly, the hair, and man, the dance moves! I did all those, and proudly at that. You wouldn&#8217;t blame me though, because like anyone who&#8217;s an 80&#8217;s kid, I&#8217;m peculiar. :)</p>
