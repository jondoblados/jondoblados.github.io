<p>There's a pretty slick Windows application that will allow you to post directly to your Blogger Beta account. The Firefox extension&nbsp;<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1811/">Deepest Sender</a>, which allows posting to LJ, Blogger, and Wordpress, doesn't work with Blogger Beta&nbsp;yet, so here's a <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!757.entry">workaround</a> that you can do meantime.</p> <p>I prefer FOSS applications that run natively on GNU/Linux, but sometimes, you really need to use a platform where you are most productive. Writing stuff&nbsp;from anywhere will mean doing this from my&nbsp;Windows-run notebook. Not so much an issue, I hope.</p>
