I wrote a memo the other day and could not help but emphasize on the importance of using good ol' wit and common sense, when on the internet. I probably had the gall to write these since I'm recklessly doing stuff on Ubuntu and couldn't care less if an intrusion breaks something. LOL. Windoze is like walking on glass. Some of the guidelines I wrote:<br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">4. Browse and click responsibly. Do not be lured by pop-up ads or<br />participate in online surveys or contests.<p />5. Stop forwarding chain mail. Although these mails may start as<br />harmless simple email messages with valid content, you do not know where<br />it has been! Think clean, and say to yourself: "This chain mail stops<br />with me." and promptly delete it.<p />6. Keep you Windows firewall or any other firewall software up! It is<br />there to protect you and not deprive you of internet activity.</blockquote>
