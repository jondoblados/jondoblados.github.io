Okay, it has been around for quite some time, and I remember writing an article about this in my older tech blog. I have a month to finish a pre-proposal on something GIS-related, so I'm seeing how this can be made possible with a renewed fascination with Google Maps.<p />I'm currently catching up on readings for my thesis pre-proposal. Some projects are quite interesting, notably those that do geographic encoding, location tracing via IP, or widget development, using <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> technology.<p />How would you like Google Maps to work for you? You can identify the need, depending on what industry you're in, and how you envision tracking applications as used in your locality. This <a href="http://www.gnik.com/wiki/GoogleMaps">guy</a> thought of plotting his GPS-generated hike/bike trails onto Google Maps. He also made mention of parcel tracking (UPS) and driving directions, both utilizing the lat/lon coordinate system of Google Maps. <p />Another implementation that I've seen in action is plotting website visitors on Google Maps, just like the application by <a href="http://www.gvisit.com/">gVisit.com</a>, which I use in this <a href="http://www.gvisit.com/map.php?sid=b2a547d8daffc469754bc929ded2caa4">website</a>. It doesn't stop there. The possibilities are mind-boggling; it will seem that the hardest part is getting down to a specific application.<p />You can get more ideas <a href="http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2005/05/31/0225">here</a> and <a href="http://libgmail.sourceforge.net/googlemaps.html">here</a>.<p />Next stop, finalizing my pre-prop.
