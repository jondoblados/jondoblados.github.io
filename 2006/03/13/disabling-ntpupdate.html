This has been quite overdue, as I have been wanting to disable <code>ntpupdate</code> since the Hoary release. What is <code>ntpupdate</code> anyway? It's the program that synchronizes your system time to an ntp server. <abbr title="Network Time Protocol">NTP</abbr> is a protocol for synchronising the clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. Since Ubuntu defaults to an ntp server somewhere in the www, and that it will attempt to sync on boot, it causes your machine to go through a much much longer startup process if an internet connection is not available at boot time.<br/><br/>As I am lugging my lappy around a lot and I have not much of a need for the program, I knew I had to take it out and save me minutes of boot time. <a href="http://blog.ealden.net">Ealden</a> taught me how to remove <code>ntpupdate</code>, and I suppose we can change the arguments to remove other programs as well.<br/><br/><code>$ sudo update-rc.d -f ntpdate remove</code><br/><br/><code>update-rc.d</code> will remove any system startup links for <code>/etc/init.d/ntpdate</code>, or any instances of such in the different run levels. Usage is as follows:<br/><div class="CodeRay"><br/>  <div class="code"><pre>usage: update-rc.d [-n] [-f] &lt;basename&gt; remove<br/>       update-rc.d [-n] &lt;basename&gt; defaults [NN | sNN kNN]<br/>       update-rc.d [-n] &lt;basename&gt; start|stop NN runlvl [runlvl] [...] .<br/>                -n: not really<br/>                -f: force</pre></div><br/></div>
