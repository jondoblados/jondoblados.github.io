We've come a long way since 2006; but it wasn't until 2009 that we had a solid team based in CDO. We're not even all sysads, but we love the fact that besides Romar, who has been my friend from way back, it was only after Carlo and Alvin joined GWF did we learn where they're from.<br/><br/>[nggallery id=4]<br/><br/>Looking forward to another TBA at the later part of this year, hopefully with more people. I heard there are new linkers from the city. Good times!
