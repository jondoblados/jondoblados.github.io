<p>I haven't written a proper blog entry since 2006. I feel that my recent entries are worthy of post tags that I would consider "forgettable", or "archive-able" (if there is such a thing).</p><br/><p>I so need motivation. Anything to get the old drive for writing flowing in my veins again. I'd appreciate any inputs from you. Just leave a comment.</p><br/><p>At this stage, I can't say I still want this blog focused on work and tech stuff. It's a great niche but while I'm transitioning, I think a few new categories will do me good. Perfectly understandable. Right.</p><br/><p><em>Update: </em>Oh, the 500-word project is a watered-down attempt at forcing myself to write. This should've been a 750-word project, but hey, I'm transitioning :p</p>
