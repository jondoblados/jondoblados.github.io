We went to Musuan, in Bukidnon. It's home to the "boob" mountain, hence the name "Musuan". Our dear Aunt Celia passed on and relatives from all over convened in CMU (where she was administrator). We spent the night in RR Family Spring Resort in Tubigon, border of Maramag, and after the wake swam in the fresh water pools, braving the intense cold. :D<br/><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://jon.doblados.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_4480.JPG.scaled1000.jpg">[gallery columns="5" orderby="post_date"]<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/></a></div>
