    <p>I recently got Ubuntu Feisty Fawn Beta running on my HP Pavilion
dv2001tu notebook, and I'm very happy with the way it's running. Here's
what I've done and have been doing the past month. Nothing out of the
ordinary for me, but some of the activities mentioned here could have
been keeping you up late at nights, coveting much of the understated
successes of<br />
running Ubuntu on HP laptops. If this is indeed so, do let me know your
woes and I'll see what I can do to help.</p>
<p>​1. Started a clan network. Okay, so most of them are really old and
have no appreciation whatsoever for the internet, much less understand
what emails are, and personalized email addresses at that. So I'll leave
this up to the younger ones, who will help me teach the older ones the
basics. They are yet to be informed of this new responsibility. LOL.</p>
<p>​2. Upgraded desktop computer to Feisty Fawn Beta, and dual-booted
Feisty and XP on my Pavilion dv2001tu lappy. So far, I have not had any
hair-tearing frustrations with Feisty. Devices seem to work off-the-box,
and the quick keys also seem to work fine (except of course for HP
QuickPlay, which doesn't do anything). Touchpad, wireless, pcm+pcm2 with
muting, and built-in mic all work. I've managed to get the built-in
webcam to run with Ekiga (more details in a future post).</p>
<p>​3. Started on my own list of what works and what doesn't for the HP
Pavilion dv2001tu. Will try to make this as authoritative and as
non-biased as possible. I love them Acer, Lenovo, and of course, Compaq
notebooks too, but since I exclusively use my dv2000, I won't be able to
vouch that the hacks I apply are going to work with the others.</p>
<p>​4. Worked on more and more domains and hostings. I eat hostings for
affiliate sites and stuff, day in and day out. I've optimized apache and
mysql for several half-a-million traffic/day sites. Log analyzers are
your best friends. I recommend Splunk for those who want to dig through
files like search engines. But there's always the basic awk, grep, and
myriad of other commands you can script together for the job.</p>
<p>​5. Promised myself I'd start updating more often. 'Nuff said. =)</p>
