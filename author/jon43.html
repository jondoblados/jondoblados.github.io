                    </h2>

                    <p>I absolutely love Gaim, but the message to group feature isn't readily
available, even with gaim2-beta3, and this doesn't work for me
especially that I sometimes need to broadcast messages to team members
over IM. Quick googling led me to Frank Spychalski's very good
<a href="http://amazing-development.com/archives/2006/01/20/using-google-talk-with-kopete/">article</a>,
which covers the essentials of configuring Google Talk on Kopete. For
Ubuntu users, if you don't have Kopete yet, you will need an internet
connection to get the necessary packages.</p>
<p>\$ sudo apt-get install -y kopete qca-tls</code></p>
<p>The <code>qca-tls</code> package will ensure that you'll be able to connect using
the default encryption protocol. After these packages install, start
Kopete, and create a new Jabber account if you don't have it yet. On the
first tab, set up your Jabber ID to use your Gmail address:<br />
<code>Jabber Id: &lt;yourid&gt;@gmail.com</code></p>
<p>On the "Connection" tab, use <code>talk.google.com</code> as your server and tick
all the boxes like so:</p>
<p><code>[x] Use protocol encryption (SSL) [x] Allow plain-text password authentication [x] Override default server information     Server: [talk.google.com]         Port: [5223]</code></p>
<p>Done!</p>

                    <p>Finally had a little time in my hands, ergo some updates. One week down.
Queen city of the South. Torrential rains. I couldn't be any more bushed
than I currently am right now. Moving residence is definitely top in my
list for most strenuous activities one can go through. It's very
prolonged; and the chores you thought you'd never do again, like wiring
the aircon <em>(Aside: among other things, and did I just forget about the
aircon frame that we hacked??)</em>, well...you end up doing them anyway.
It's by God's grace that I haven't felt the flu creeping in yet. Maybe
it'll never get the chance to.</p>
<p>Special thanks go to my in-laws, who went with us and carried some of
our hand-carried items, to Papa Jun, who's always ready to pick us up
from the port whenever we're in the area, <em>(Aside: guess what, we're
settling down here, but I still hope he'd keep doing this until I get a
car to do this myself...soon.)</em> and to my parents and brother, who lent
us a few (and very important) items to get us by while I pay off the
fridge and aircon.</p>
<p>Papa's out of practice. It's funny because it seemed like we changed
roles already; him assisting me. I'm thankful he stayed up late just to
make sure we finished wiring the darn thing. It was so stiffling hot and
we needed some cooling so we'd get to sleep already.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm up to my neck with work already. It's just one project for
now, but I'm still trying to adjust to a predominantly Windoze
environment. I got a go-ahead from the boss, so I'm going GNULinux over
the weekend. Bliss!</p>

                    <p><em>Originally <a href="http://trigger.cdo.linux.org.ph/?p=137">posted</a> in my
"other" blog.</em><br />
By the end of the month, I will be moving to the Queen City of the
South, with my family in tow. I’m just glad that those guys at the new
company were willing to wait for me. I was sure they understood the
situation; I have established base in CDO and am currently employed. I
was the one who was getting uprooted, so it was just proper that they
agreed to waiting. Yes, I’ve tendered my resignation, and although a
couple of times last week when I felt like I kicking myself in the ass,
(I was starting to feel like some sort of sacrificial lamb), I remember
the reasons _why_ my wife and I decided to take the plunge.  </p>
<p>As a direct result of my sudden resignation, manpower and work load
concerns that we’ve been raising for years are finally being addressed.
I just feel like the fall guy here, because I _know_ that if this
pushes through, remuneration for my colleagues is ensured, on the basis
of supervisory work load, and I can’t have any of it.  </p>
<p>However, I’m happy that all these are happening, for three reasons.
First, I will be able to _focus_ on web programming, a passion if I
may call it. My wife sees this in me. She knows it’s the one thing that
keeps me up till the wee hours of the morning, and I’d still be able to
do what needs to get done in the house, or spend time with her and our
daughter without spacing out. Second, I wouldn’t want anything less than
give my colleagues their happiness. They deserve greater things in life.
Incoming!!! Lastly, and most importantly, we get to live on our own;
just myself, my wife, and our daughter. To God be the glory!</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Over the Holy Week, two of our home computer's drives crashed, probably
due to extensive user download, software installs, and malware. I had to
do work on the laptop for a while, and since everyone in the house was
itching for Internet access, I brought in a small IDE drive (roughly
around 9Gb) that was mounted as slave on my office computer and popped
that in the home computer. I had more than enough reasons to put Ubuntu
back in there, and nobody would be complaining!</p>
<p>Initially, I did a Breezy install and got all the needed packages up
to-date. I wanted more so I changed all "breezy" references to "dapper"
in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>, and did <code>sudo apt-get update</code>, and
<code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code>.
<abbr title="If I Remember Correctly">IIRC</abbr>, a total of 940+
packages had to be updated over an estimated 4 and a half hours. I left
the computer running overnight, woke up at around 2 am and finished the
installs and configurations.</p>
<p>By morning, my wife, daughter, and sister-in-law, were able to use the
computer for Internet surfing. I was able to recover their personal
documents and multimedia files in the office; and just last night
uploaded their files via an external USB-mounted hard drive that we use
for mobile backups at work.</p>
<p>I just love Dapper! The default Human theme's colors and icons just
totally rawk, and for a while, I didn't feel the need to install another
theme. Well my kid really likes Gartoon, and since her gcompris theme is
already in Gartoon, I installed that theme as well.</p>
<p>Mark Shuttleworth posted an announcement last night on planning
Dapper+1. He divulged that the codename for the next release would be
the "Edgy Eft", saying that:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edgy is all about cutting edge, perhaps bleeding edge,<br />
brand new code and infrastructure. It will be the right time to bring
in<br />
some seriously interesting but definitely edgy new technologies which<br />
lay the groundwork for the next wave of Ubuntu development.<br />
</p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "bleeding edge" phrase is so Fedora Core, but IMO, Ubuntu won't be
like that in any way. Mark did say they were going to explore slightly
unfamiliar territory that is out of the mainstream. This controlled
exploration of technology will definitely bring Ubuntu as a GNU/Linux
distribution to very, very high levels. The good stuff is just around
the corner: Xen for virtualization (awesome GPLed technology that
<a href="http://jon.doblados.net/rimuhosting.com">rimuhosting.com</a> has been
using for years!), multi-architecture support, and the XGL that blows
away just about everyone.</p>
<p>To infinity, and beyond!</p>
