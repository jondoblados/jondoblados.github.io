                    <p>Robert Horry's the man!!! What a clincher for a do-or-die game 5 for the
Spurs! Horry's 3 pointer shots saved his team twice, once to secure an
OT, and the second to give them a 1-shot victory over the Pistons!  </p>
<p>Simply awesome!</p>

                    <p>i'm really hoping my old server gets up soon so i can download my shit
out and start publishing again from our own servers here. all my scripts
and applications that have been published are there, and most of the
updates i did are there. the server went out even before i could sync my
local copies. dumbass right? like why in the world would you be doing
sync from a remote? ah, but i was "live" editing...which is very very
bad, imo.  </p>
<p>anyway, here's to hoping i can ssh back to that server again within the
week. arghh!</p>

                    <p>I'm back at work. My recent sickness made me think again about my eating
habits, my vices, and how I love shunning medication and prescriptions;
preferring proper rest and vigorous exercise over anything
pharmaceutically made. It was a community-acquired viral infection that
made the insides of my lungs all pulpy and lugaw-like. I was short of
getting the P200+ kind of antibiotic. It was a good thing I was
responding well to what I was taking in. I now see how important
medication is, especially if you're down with something viral.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I'm glad I'm not smoking anymore, so it made things a whole lot
easier. I had thought initially that I wasn't getting any better any
faster than when I was still smoking (coughs used to go away after a
couple of days) because it took me almost a month to recover.  </p>
<p>So I made it through. My wife's getting better and she'll be able to
remove the dressings by the end of the week. Kysa also went to her first
K1 school day today. She got too excited to even kiss her mama and papa
bye-bye before dashing out towards the waiting school bus.  </p>
<p>I came in this morning feeling optimistic, which was quelled almost
immediately as I started wading through tons of email and notifications.
And I won't get off work until 7pm! Somebody tell me again that this
going back to school thing is worth it...really!</p>
