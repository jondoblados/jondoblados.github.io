<p>The authors have sufficiently summarized the study by including the
purpose, methods, results, and conclusions or summary. The study has
identified positional error correction as their purpose, with the
objective of determining if the errors in geographic encoding could
impact results. The study focused on the discussion of the ability of
GIS-based applications to locate residential addresses as closely as
possible with the proposed alternative method of geographic encoding
using residential property parcel data, instead of the automated
geographic encoding.</p>
<p>The study emphasized on the application of GIS-based systems in public
health, and how important precision in geographic encoding is to
ensuring that public health studies are not compromised. There is
extensive literature review on geographic encoding. The authors have
noted that the underlying concepts and theories of this study have been
documented in other studies, in that they were able to present the
problem and justify the need for research. The study also indicates that
there was limited public information on positional error correction,
further emphasizing the need for research.</p>
<p>The problem statement has clearly identified what needs investigation,
which emphasized on finding out if positional errors could impact public
health data analysis results. As a solution, the authors have proposed
their method of geographic encoding, which they expect to address these
concerns.</p>
<p>The authors were able to specifically indicate their methods for
collection of geographic data, beginning with residential addresses.
This data is used as a starting point for geographic encoding and
analysis. The authors indicated some exceptions, which according to
them, will greatly increase positional errors in any geographic encoding
method because of some missing details in the geographic data. The
geographic encoding process was presented, together with the validation
methods that were used in showing how much positional error resulted
from the geographic encoding methods used. The authors were likewise
specific in the analysis methods that they used for the study.</p>
<p>Although quite brief, the authors were able to present the results of
their study well, using tables to compare positional errors between the
geographic encoding methods used. The researchers were also very
thorough in their discussion of their findings, pointing out the obvious
improvements in positional error correction with their proposed method
of geographic encoding. They also made suggestions as to how parcel
points can be standardized, because the encoding and storage of this
data is done by the local government and may not exist in similar
formats.</p>
<p>The authors made recommendations for improvements, stating that their
study is localized and may not be reflective of the level of positional
error that the current geographic encoding method has, using
topographically integrated geographic encoding and reference files.</p>

                    <p>
I am one with the millions of CSI fans raring to watch the 2-hour season
finale of the top rated series on television. Quentin Tarantino has been
tapped to direct this one and I'm sure it'll be a very, very good 2
hours. My daughter needs to sleep a good hour before that starts because
she won't sleep if she sees CSI on. Like father, like daughter.

I posted this on my [tech blog](http://trigger.cdo.linux.org.ph/), but I
feel that I'll probably have more people see it here in LJ, which will
hopefully translate to more ready answers for me. I did a script that
displays my planner's buffer files. It would've been easier if I used
emac's wiki publishing, but I wanted to format the output so that it'll
look good on wp, and decided on it otherwise. Save for some quirks on
the display, my tasks list shows up just fine.  

I was asking around earlier about system-dependent directory reading
methods. I couldn't get my display to sort properly. So what exactly is
the order in which directory items are fetched? In the php manual:  


>   
> Note:   
> The order in which directory entries are returned by the read method
> is system-dependent.
> </p>

<p>

I would assume that a system read from a directory will return an
alphanumerically sorted list, but I had the feeling that it isn't the
case here. I used the `dir` class (readily available in php3 and up).  


> A pseudo-object oriented mechanism for reading a directory. The given
> directory is opened. Two properties are available once the directory
> has been opened. The handle property can be used with other directory
> functions such as readdir(), rewinddir() and closedir(). The path
> property is set to path the directory that was opened. Three methods
> are available: read, rewind and close.
> </p>

<p>No parameters passed to any of these three methods. Sucks.</p>

                    <p>In my quest to have my "dead" blog resuscitated on our new p5 server so
that I have something to use for my tech notes here at work as well as
my MS requirements, I downloaded <code>MySQL-4.1.12-0.sles9.src.rpm</code> from
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">mysql.com</a> in the hope of getting
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> running on our server. I can't seem
to install the darn thing. So I dl'ed
<code>mysql-standard-4.1.12-unknown-linux-gnu-powerpc-glibc23.tar.gz</code> and
tried to use the binaries instead.  </p>
<p>Viola! MySQL4.1.12 managed to run fine. The only problem is that even
with all the usual accounts set up, including privileges and access
rights to hosts set up correctly, wordpress can't connect to the
localhost database. Baaaaad!!! I ended up setting up the database on my
trusty workstation and connected to that instead.  </p>
