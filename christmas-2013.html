    <p>We decided to go to Cebu and spend Christmas this year with my parents
and brother. I suppose it has been more than 15 years since we last
celebrated Christmas together. The trip was really stressful because it
was passenger season. But it was really worth lugging heavy bags since
the cousins got to goof off and have a lot of fun, and the grandparents
got to see all of their grandchildren in one place.</p>
<p>~~I've included most of the pictures I've taken with my phone in the
gallery below.~~Â <em>[1/16/2015] I've embedded the Google+ Photos album
here.</em> The first few ones are some of the auto-awesomed pics generated
by Google. These animated gifs are posted full-size because Wordpress
strips off the frames when it generates the smaller versions of these
pictures. After having seen these in one place, I now wish I took more
burst shots, especially the ones with Papa and Mama. I guess they'll
have to be content with the non-animated regular pictures.</p>
