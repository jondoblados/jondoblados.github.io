<p>I&#8217;ve gone impulsive again. I was waiting for a good time to make this personal (more or less) blog, public.   But then I realize that I may have just been waiting for my hair to grow back.  Believe me, that&#8217;s going to take much, much longer!</p><br/><p>I may as well chronicle everything now that my kids are growing up.  I also think that I and my wife are now going through that most interesting phase of life, and it&#8217;s probably worth writing about.  Nothing related to midlife crisis yet, thank God, but definitely worth sharing.</p><br/><p>All of my tech posts are now on <a href="http://tech.doblados.net" title="aggregated thinking">tech.doblados.net</a> (about time!!) Do you think it&#8217;s better this way?</p>
