<p>I love my wife. She's all about the greater levels of thoughtfulness <br />that I don't have, and earlier today, she's outdone herself once more. <p /> In a few hours she had completed all of her Christmas shopping for my <br />god-children and nephews and nieces. No thanks to me; I couldn't stand <br />gift shopping unless it's for her or my kids, much worse if it's for <br />some other people. <p /> Don't get me wrong, I'm all for giving gifts as long as it's in the <br />budget, but man, only my wife can think of what stuff to buy. Where <br />was I earlier while my wife was ticking off her shop list? In Roti Mum <br />having coffee and buns! Tsk.. <p /> My daughter also got bought some clothes and I can see that she's very <br />happy with them. Oh well, that's supermom for you!</p>
