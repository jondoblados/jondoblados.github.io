    <p>I love my wife. She's all about the greater levels of thoughtfulness <br />
that I don't have, and earlier today, she's outdone herself once more.</p>
<p>In a few hours she had completed all of her Christmas shopping for my <br />
god-children and nephews and nieces. No thanks to me; I couldn't stand <br />
gift shopping unless it's for her or my kids, much worse if it's for <br />
some other people.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm all for giving gifts as long as it's in the <br />
budget, but man, only my wife can think of what stuff to buy. Where <br />
was I earlier while my wife was ticking off her shop list? In Roti Mum <br />
having coffee and buns! Tsk..</p>
<p>My daughter also got bought some clothes and I can see that she's very <br />
happy with them. Oh well, that's supermom for you!</p>
