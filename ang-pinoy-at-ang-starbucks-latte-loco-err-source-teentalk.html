<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Only in the Philippines will you see people ditching the
comfort of sipping a cup of Starbucks coffee inside the
airconditioned store and preferring instead to sit outside and be
soaked dry by the heat of the tropical sun.</strong></p>
<p>The reason? Kailangan makita ng friends/classmates/kakilala ko na
nandito ako sa Starbucks! Magpapakasosyal na lang, e di i-todo ko
na.</p>
<p><em>The lesson? Sit where you would be seen easily the most</em>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Only in the Philippines will you see people bringing their
laptops inside the Starbucks store and staying there for hours and
hours just to avail of the free Wi-Fi.</strong></p>
<p>The reason: Para mukha talagang sosyal, kailangan busy-busyhan gamit
ang laptop habang sip ng coffee. Makikisaksak pa yan para
maki-charge at naka cross legs pa sa upuan para feel at home.
Feeling bahay ko na itong Starbucks. I own it, you know?</p>
<p><em>The lesson: Make sure to bring your laptop no matter how heavy it
is. The attention you will get is priceless, anyway!</em></p>
<p><strong>3. Only in the Philippines will you see people giving strange
names when asked by the barista for their personal name to be
written on the cup. The names oftentimes teeter at the brink of
being lewd and/or profane (e.g. Lucky T T or Ba Hoko).</strong></p>
<p>The reason: Siyempre kapag sinigaw ng barista yung name,
magtatawanan kami ng circle of friends ko. I got the attention I am
so craving for again. They are all looking at me o! Bwahahaha!</p>
<p><em>The lesson: Be prepared with the most attention-grabbing name
(those with sexual innuendos are most recommended) to be written on
your cup and later on to be shouted by the drop-dead gorgeous
barista who would melt in front of everybody after shouting Lucky
T.T. or Ba Hoko.</em></p>
<p><strong>4. Only in the Philippines will you see people taking pictures of
themselves all the time and from all possible angles while sipping
their favorite ice-cold frapp. You will be surprised to see how the
Starbucks logo is almost always part of the frame!</strong></p>
<p>The reason: I need to upload this in my Multiply, Friendster,
Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, Blogspot, Faceparty, hi5, Livejournal,
Plurk accountssss-sssssss! I need to anonymously view and comment
para maraming views at laging nasa top ako ng page sa updates! My
friends need to see na nag Starbucks ako! Sayang P120 ko kapag hindi
nila nakita picture ko! Huhuhuhuhuhu….</p>
<p><strong>5. Only in the Philippines will you see people getting a lot of
extra sugar, cream and tissue. And when I say a lot, it means its
damn too many!</strong></p>
<p>The reason: I paid P150 for my venti java chip mocha frapp, I should
at least deserve to get a year’s supply of that fiber tissue with
the Starbucks logo on them! Sagarin ko na yung binayad ko, and mahal
kasi eh! Penge na rin extra, extra, extra sugar ska super extra,
extra, extra na cream [Tapos biglang tago sa bag!]</p>
<p><em>The lesson: Everybody knows that the coffee is overpriced. So get
your money’s worth! Grab as much fiber tissue, sugar and cream
sachets that can fit in your bag! And dont forget to bring a huge
bag to begin with!</em></p>
<p><strong>6. Only in the Philippines will you see people gulping on twenty
venti cups of frapp in one night just to get the oh-so-precious
Starbucks planner!</strong></p>
<p>The reason: !@#\$, lahat may naka display na Starbucks planner sa
kamay nila! Dapat ako rin! [Sabay tungga ng dalawampung cups ng
venti frap] Kahit mejo tinamaan doon sa coffee overdose, makikipila
pa rin para ma claim ang Starbucks planner [khit gaano pa ito
ka-cheap tingnan]</p>
<p><em>The lesson: Secretly ask your friends for their stickers to
complete your collection. In that way, you won’t be spending 2500
pesos for a stupid-looking planner which you do not intend to write
on anyway. Your life is a mess dude! What on earth would you do with
a planner/organizer you dumbass!</em></p>
<p><strong>7. Only in the Philippines will you see people holding on to their
Starbucks tumblers while they are, well, practically everywhere - on
the streets, inside the train, inside the comfort room, etc. What is
ironic is that when nobody is watching, they put in their Nescafe
3-in-1 coffee mix inside their Starbucks tumblers and drink their
heart away to cheap coffee. Aaahhhhh, sarap talaga ng 3-in-1!</strong></p>
<p>The reason: Basta may Starbucks logo, sosyal! Kaya kailangan
dala-dala ko ito lagi! Keber b nila kung Nescafe 3-in-1 yung nasa
tumbler ko! Starbucks ito o! Ayan yung logo, tingnan mo!</p>
<p><em>The lesson: Never ever let anyone catch you put that Nescafe 3-in-1
coffee mix into your Starbucks tumbler. That will so ruin your
reputation among all the Embassy-going folks and ecstasy-sniffing
elites out there.</em></p>
<p>Just as when hundreds of Starbucks stores have started to close shop
in every major city around the world, at least three new stores open
their doors in Manila [or at least in a lighted street corner
somewhere around the city] every month. A bit anomalous isn’t it?
The truth is that we are perhaps just in the middle of a brewing
(pardon me for the intentional pun) coffee craze, or perhaps
Starbucks obsession / Starbucks mania / Starbucks phenomenon - call
it by any other monicker, but Filipinos are definitely in love with
the Seattle-based coffee chain. Now, how on earth could an American
export selling coffee for P120 per cup be such a hit in a third
world country like the Philippines where half of the population
lives on less than P100 a day?
