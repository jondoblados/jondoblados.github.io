> > **1. Only in the Philippines will you see people ditching the
> > comfort of sipping a cup of Starbucks coffee inside the
> > airconditioned store and preferring instead to sit outside and be
> > soaked dry by the heat of the tropical sun.**
> >
> > The reason? Kailangan makita ng friends/classmates/kakilala ko na
> > nandito ako sa Starbucks! Magpapakasosyal na lang, e di i-todo ko
> > na.
> >
> > *The lesson? Sit where you would be seen easily the most*.
> >
> > **2. Only in the Philippines will you see people bringing their
> > laptops inside the Starbucks store and staying there for hours and
> > hours just to avail of the free Wi-Fi.**
> >
> > The reason: Para mukha talagang sosyal, kailangan busy-busyhan gamit
> > ang laptop habang sip ng coffee. Makikisaksak pa yan para
> > maki-charge at naka cross legs pa sa upuan para feel at home.
> > Feeling bahay ko na itong Starbucks. I own it, you know?
> >
> > *The lesson: Make sure to bring your laptop no matter how heavy it
> > is. The attention you will get is priceless, anyway!*
> >
> > **3. Only in the Philippines will you see people giving strange
> > names when asked by the barista for their personal name to be
> > written on the cup. The names oftentimes teeter at the brink of
> > being lewd and/or profane (e.g. Lucky T T or Ba Hoko).**
> >
> > The reason: Siyempre kapag sinigaw ng barista yung name,
> > magtatawanan kami ng circle of friends ko. I got the attention I am
> > so craving for again. They are all looking at me o! Bwahahaha!
> >
> > *The lesson: Be prepared with the most attention-grabbing name
> > (those with sexual innuendos are most recommended) to be written on
> > your cup and later on to be shouted by the drop-dead gorgeous
> > barista who would melt in front of everybody after shouting Lucky
> > T.T. or Ba Hoko.*

> > **4. Only in the Philippines will you see people taking pictures of
> > themselves all the time and from all possible angles while sipping
> > their favorite ice-cold frapp. You will be surprised to see how the
> > Starbucks logo is almost always part of the frame!**
> >
> > The reason: I need to upload this in my Multiply, Friendster,
> > Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, Blogspot, Faceparty, hi5, Livejournal,
> > Plurk accountssss-sssssss! I need to anonymously view and comment
> > para maraming views at laging nasa top ako ng page sa updates! My
> > friends need to see na nag Starbucks ako! Sayang P120 ko kapag hindi
> > nila nakita picture ko! Huhuhuhuhuhu….
> >
> > **5. Only in the Philippines will you see people getting a lot of
> > extra sugar, cream and tissue. And when I say a lot, it means its
> > damn too many!**
> >
> > The reason: I paid P150 for my venti java chip mocha frapp, I should
> > at least deserve to get a year’s supply of that fiber tissue with
> > the Starbucks logo on them! Sagarin ko na yung binayad ko, and mahal
> > kasi eh! Penge na rin extra, extra, extra sugar ska super extra,
> > extra, extra na cream [Tapos biglang tago sa bag!]
> >
> > *The lesson: Everybody knows that the coffee is overpriced. So get
> > your money’s worth! Grab as much fiber tissue, sugar and cream
> > sachets that can fit in your bag! And dont forget to bring a huge
> > bag to begin with!*
> >
> > **6. Only in the Philippines will you see people gulping on twenty
> > venti cups of frapp in one night just to get the oh-so-precious
> > Starbucks planner!**
> >
> > The reason: !@\#\$, lahat may naka display na Starbucks planner sa
> > kamay nila! Dapat ako rin! [Sabay tungga ng dalawampung cups ng
> > venti frap] Kahit mejo tinamaan doon sa coffee overdose, makikipila
> > pa rin para ma claim ang Starbucks planner [khit gaano pa ito
> > ka-cheap tingnan]
> >
> > *The lesson: Secretly ask your friends for their stickers to
> > complete your collection. In that way, you won’t be spending 2500
> > pesos for a stupid-looking planner which you do not intend to write
> > on anyway. Your life is a mess dude! What on earth would you do with
> > a planner/organizer you dumbass!*
> >
> > **7. Only in the Philippines will you see people holding on to their
> > Starbucks tumblers while they are, well, practically everywhere - on
> > the streets, inside the train, inside the comfort room, etc. What is
> > ironic is that when nobody is watching, they put in their Nescafe
> > 3-in-1 coffee mix inside their Starbucks tumblers and drink their
> > heart away to cheap coffee. Aaahhhhh, sarap talaga ng 3-in-1!**
> >
> > The reason: Basta may Starbucks logo, sosyal! Kaya kailangan
> > dala-dala ko ito lagi! Keber b nila kung Nescafe 3-in-1 yung nasa
> > tumbler ko! Starbucks ito o! Ayan yung logo, tingnan mo!
> >
> > *The lesson: Never ever let anyone catch you put that Nescafe 3-in-1
> > coffee mix into your Starbucks tumbler. That will so ruin your
> > reputation among all the Embassy-going folks and ecstasy-sniffing
> > elites out there.*
> >
> > Just as when hundreds of Starbucks stores have started to close shop
