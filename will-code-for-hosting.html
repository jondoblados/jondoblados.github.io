    <p>Honestly, I haven't done any coding in the last 4 months, which is
really odd, because I never thought I'd be this detached from
programming. But I guess there's more to life than just developing or
sustaining passion for singulars. So much for trying not to stay
generalist.</p>
<p>So I have this personal domain now, and I'm just glad google apps isn't
as stiff with the applications anymore. The new interface totally rocks
too. I just need to host the domain somewhere, for sites and blogs and
stuff.</p>
<p>If you're family, and you have a blogger account, I can get you your
custom domain working. The default blogspot.com publishing URL
will redirect to your custom domain, so I guess you won't be losing any
visitors.</p>
<p>I'm not that sure about this, but I feel that there will be noticeable
changes in how your blog fares with SE's. Some SEO stuff that I've
picked up tell me you can't have same content in multiple sites, similar
to double-posting. Seems like you can get penalized for that. Question
is, will the application of this redirecting exercise on blog a (that
has already been indexed) be seen as same content with blog b (which is
where blog a will redirect to, if and only if you decide on a custom
domain), from a search engine's view?</p>
<p>Anyway, I need a host. :) Ironically, I handle dozens of hosts; but I
can't get anywhere close to those (all dedicated servers..boohoohoo)
without first coughing up lots of cash. Yea I suppose I could just code
for it.</p>
