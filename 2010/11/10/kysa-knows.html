Well here are a couple of shots of our princess, who was trying to finish off her purchases so she can brush teeth and sleep already. She's tried doing some blogging in her spare time (I think this is a good thing for her) and you can follow her <a title="Kysa Knows" href="http://kysa.doblados.net" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-11-16/yAJgClxDmdBCddwhnwEtjDfEwtaDcpigBEJIkxFjvorbyCEjEBgajafFzqCz/Picture_139.jpg.scaled1000.jpg"><img src="http://jon.doblados.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Picture_139.jpg.scaled500-300x225.jpg" alt="Picture_139" width="500" height="375" /></a></div><br/>Nomnomnom!
