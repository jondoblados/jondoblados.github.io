Earlier today, we let Miguel tag along with us to David's in Divisoria. We weren't sure if Miguel was ready to have his first "official" haircut. After seeing all of us get trimmed by Peter (he's the only one who cuts our hair), it looked like he was okay to get one too, until someone wrapped a barber's cape around his neck and the screeching started. LOL!<br/><br/>He did pause a few times to try to smile at the camera through tears. Awww. It took Peter about 10 minutes to properly trim Miguel's ultra fine hair since he moved a lot, and I had to hold him standing up on my lap and steady his head at the same time. But the outcome's great! Our son looks real handsome now that he has shorter hair.<br/><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://jon.doblados.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_4186.jpg.scaled1000.jpg">[gallery columns="4" orderby="post_date"]<br/></a></div>
