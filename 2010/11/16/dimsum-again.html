We love Dimsum Diner, but we gotta start learning to keep ourselves from eating there too often. Why? We're all high risk people, that's why.<br/><br/>In this set, my sister-in-law was playing around with the camera settings, which explains the no-flash feature. Will try to do another shoot next time and will play with ISO and WB. Not a DSLR. Lugging that with us during family eat-outs is overkill.<br/><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://jon.doblados.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Picture_030.jpg.scaled1000.jpg">[gallery columns="5" orderby="post_date"]<br/></a></div>
