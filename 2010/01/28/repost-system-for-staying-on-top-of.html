<p>I&#8217;ve tried a lot of productivity tools to get better control over my ever-bloating task lists, and none have been as effective for me, as using Gmail with the GTDInbox add-on, and Google Tasks. How I make these work for me is a result of several months of trials, using Google Tasks initially, then with custom labeling and automatic label switching with GTDInbox.</p><br/><p>The goal was simple, and that was to attain inbox zero at least once a day. GTDInbox allows me to mark or tag emails containing tasks with action, wait-for, delegated, and finished. After the emails are tagged, they get added to Google Tasks, so that I&#8217;ll have an easy way to pull up a related email for a particular task. Lastly, these emails get archived, keeping the goal of inbox zero in mind, always.</p><br/><p>What tools do you use, and have you already gotten into a rhythm of using these efficiently while working?</p>
