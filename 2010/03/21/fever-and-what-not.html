<p>I dare not say what we hope our daughter didn&#8217;t get that&#8217;s causing her on and off high fever since Tuesday night. We&#8217;re still hopeful that it&#8217;s some ordinary viral infection that&#8217;s been plaguing kids these hot El Nino days.</p><br/><p>My wife and I are in distress due to lack of sleep, but we&#8217;re still hopeful. We were advised to wait until 6pm tonight to get another CBC exam. That&#8217;s because aside from her fever, she hasn&#8217;t been showing the other symptoms, e.g. nausea/vomiting, joint pains, tummy pains, etc.</p><br/><p>Well, she&#8217;s known to not complain about pain unless it&#8217;s caused by a needle. So we&#8217;re not taking chances. After all, you&#8217;d do everything for your kids, right?</p>
