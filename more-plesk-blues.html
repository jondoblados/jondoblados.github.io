I've had this problem with Plesk since I started relying heavily on it
in 2006.  For some reason, after you've added your client, allocated IP
address to client's pool, added a domain, and selecting physical
hosting, you get the message:

> Unable to update hosting preferences: hosting update is failed: object
> ID is invalid
> </p>

<p>After getting this error, you get the domain listed, but still requiring
set up.  Attempting to complete physical hosting setup will give you
same result.  First thing you'd want to look at would be some log. For
all of its peculiarities, Plesk has an organized directory tree. Look at
<code>/usr/local/psa/admin/logs/httpsd_error_log</code> and you'll see that
skeleton or template is missing.</p>
<p>I didn't know exactly where to get the <code>.skel</code> directory, but some
Googling led me to <code>/home/httpd/vhosts/.skel/0</code>, which after some
directory skimming, I was able to verify as non-existent. I simply
copied an existing <code>.skel</code> directory from one of our other servers and
redid the physical hosting setup.</p>
<p>I'll see if I can find out what's causing the <code>.skel</code> directory to cease
to exist. This is a fairly easier to solve issue. I so need to start
looking in forums of Parallels (formerly SWSoft) for solutions.</p>
