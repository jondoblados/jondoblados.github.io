    <p>I got really dissed last night waiting for instructors to report for
class. It almost seemed prank-like to me, because we were all waiting
for this guy to show up, and just a few minutes before we were afforded
a free cut, somebody got SMS from the instructor, apologizing that he
wasn't going to make it (again). It probably came late because of
network lag, but I'd glady discount that because it was a 3-hr class and
we waited for almost an hour for the cut.  </p>
<p>As I was not used to waiting (and doing nothing), I whipped out my
notebook and started scribbling diagrams and policy tables for the
firewall I was configuring for the last 3 days. Looking at these notes
now, I'm glad I did them last night. I came in this morning sort of
blank...and couldn't remember what I did yesterday. Creepy.  </p>
<p>Instructors better report tonight!  </p>
