    <p>nuthin new...i still got sPrOcK up to my neck trying to fix wut went
wrong with the servers over the holidays. why do unwanted things have to
happen when nobody's in the office? :D  </p>
<p>happy three kings! whoopeee for Philippine politics! thanks to the
upcoming elections, my job is starting to sound like a lost cause or
sumthin. my wife's about done with her nursing anyway, but it'll be
another 2 years or so before she can go anywhere; unless some hospital
needs a nutritionist/dietician first, nurse second...then maybe, just
maybe...it'll be a lot earlier.  </p>
<p>can't get jakarta-tomcat-5.0.16 to cooperate with apache...or IIS. the
connectors i needed aren't coming off the racks as nightly builds
anymore. hahaaay...anyway, i wouldn't be advocating open source if i
didn't believe in it so...imma shut my trap now hehe...</p>
