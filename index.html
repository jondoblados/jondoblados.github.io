        For the upteenth time, I&rsquo;m switching to an all-static approach to writing. Since Go (the programming language) has been quite popular with most of the 3rd-party tools we use, most particularly Traefik, I&rsquo;ve decided to start reading and learning about this programming language and document exercises and attempts at using it for tooling. It also makes sense to use Hugo, an ultra-fast and modern static site generator written in Go, as my writing tool.

        Back in November last year, the Apps Services Partner that I help with Google Apps Support told me that I was required to take the Google Apps for Work Deployment Specialist certification exam. I learned that Google was going to end the certification program and that I had to take the exam January 5, 2016. It turns out that they were simplifying the Partner Credential Program. All good!
So I took a crash review during the holiday break, read through all Google Apps for Work help articles I could get my hands on, and did self-study on Google Apps Administrator Fundamentals and Deployment Essentials.

        In my previous employment, I didn&rsquo;t have any problems with submitting reports, practically because we used a time management/monitoring tool and the reports sort of generated by themselves. So when submitting daily reports isn&rsquo;t the norm here at the unit, quarterly reports become quite tricky.
I&rsquo;ve resorted to referring to Google Calendar as most of the stuff we do are usually scheduled. I&rsquo;ve also thought of logging everything on a text file and have pelican publish this to my website.

        By 2016, five higher education institutes (HEIs) here in the Philippines will be integrating Technopreneurship as an offered elective for their Engineering programs. I am quite thankful that the higher education authorities have included my alma mater. More than being the center of trade in Northern Mindanao, the strategic location of our city makes it the best option for I.T. companies to build or expand in.
While the article specifically mentions entrepeneurship training for future engineers and that inclusion will be done in the Engineering curricula of 5 HEIs, I feel that this is severely limiting the beneficiaries (e.

        I didn&rsquo;t think there was going to be any hope for my early 2011 MacBook Pro, which had GPU-related problems after only about a year of use. The only obvious option I had was to buy a replacement laptop. But Apple seems to have been receiving a lot of reports that they&rsquo;ve launched a repair progam that will fix the graphics problem for free.
If you bought a 15-inch or 17-inch MacBook Pro between early 2011 and end of 2013, as well as the first two generations of the Retina models, you&rsquo;re in luck.

        I just made the first step towards moving my whole blog to GitHub and going all static! Content is generated by Pelican, a static site generator, written in Python. Why GitHub, you ask? While I can always push the static content to any of my existing web hosts, there&rsquo;s a touch of geekness in writing using my favorite editor and publishing by git commits and pushes; thus GitHub. Also, it&rsquo;s this year that I&rsquo;m planning to pick up Python programming again, for devops reasons.

        Earlier today we scheduled the racking of our old C-Class HP BladeSystem. It used to be wrapped in its own enclosure with wheels to boot, but it didn&rsquo;t make sense to have it stand outside the cabinets. So we gave heads up and asked some guys to stay behind after office hours. Thanks to Mona, Eric, Jing, Tim, and Mark(?) for the assist!
Next up, the classic IBM BladeCenter!

        10 years ago, I wouldn&rsquo;t be complaining at all. I could live in a datacenter for days until the job&rsquo;s done. But these days, my back aches are more pronounced, and fatigue sets in more easily. This is why it&rsquo;s always great to have others helping out. Thanks to the CISO and PPO teams for making the migrations happen! I may have gotten older but the one thing that doesn&rsquo;t change is the thrill of the job.

        Unlike in the late 90s to mid 2000s, desktop real estate is no longer constrained by the number of monitors you use. We now tout the number of virtual machines we have access to. In fact, my ailing MBP has managed to remain useful because remote access still enables me to work on all our VMs. Our applications and storage servers are all virtualized. Even some legacy systems have been replicated on VMs, allowing us to retire old and bulky server hardware.

        I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be saying this many years down the road, but here goes anyway. Crystal Reports is my friend. Yep. Apparently, I&rsquo;ve forgotten my disdain for this piece of software. It&rsquo;s amusing (well, for me) that the last version of Crystal Reports that I used for the systems I developed back in the late 90s, is the same version I was forced to use last week, in modifying an old report template.
