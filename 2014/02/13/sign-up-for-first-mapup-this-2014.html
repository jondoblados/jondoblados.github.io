<p>This is our opening salvo for the year. Since we started last year, GBG Cagayan de Oro has been receiving a lot of good feedback from the locals. But we've put our attention on the areas where we can improve, and I really believe that this mapping event is a step towards that direction. A well-mapped city improves tourism and support services. It also opens numerous planning opportunities for the local government. I hope someone from city hall would attend this time. :)</p><p><div class="g-post" data-href="https://plus.google.com/114642277785568765419/posts/SRGWgAi4QDp"></div></p>
