I sometimes wish it were me. But I’d rather have my daughter bask in her moment. It’s just that I clearly remember the feeling. You’re all bubbly and excited, and you can’t stop talking about it. My daughter’s graduating from preschool tomorrow, and my wife and I are as much into the rush as she is.
