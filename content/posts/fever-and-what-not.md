I dare not say what we hope our daughter didn’t get that’s causing her on and off high fever since Tuesday night. We’re still hopeful that it’s some ordinary viral infection that’s been plaguing kids these hot El Nino days.

  

My wife and I are in distress due to lack of sleep, but we’re still hopeful. We were advised to wait until 6pm tonight to get another CBC exam. That’s because aside from her fever, she hasn’t been showing the other symptoms, e.g. nausea/vomiting, joint pains, tummy pains, etc.

  

Well, she’s known to not complain about pain unless it’s caused by a needle. So we’re not taking chances. After all, you’d do everything for your kids, right?
