We partnered with the Kinaadman Research Center (KRC) and through the auspices of Dr. Ester Raagas, Director of the KRC, 67.7% of the entire university faculty population who were also research grantees, were able to learn about Google Drive.  
  
  
  
The workshop focused on emphasizing the features of Google Drive and Google+ that are applicable for rapid data gathering, information sharing, collaborative work, and documentation.  
  
We would like to thank Dr. Raagas and her team, as well as the Research and Outreach Cluster of Xavier University for their support. Mabuhay po kayo! :)
