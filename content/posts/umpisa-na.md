man, this morning i sent off my kid to her first school day. she was too excited to even give me a hug before i reported for work. we decided on sending her to a montessori-patterned school for the summer so as to allow her to adjust to school life before she starts K1 in SMS this June (equivalent to Nursery in other schools). she hasn’t gone through toddler’s/playgroup class, so this will be her first. most of her would-be classmates this June already have the edge of going through toddler’s class.  
  
i still believe in burnouts though. so much for cramming…
