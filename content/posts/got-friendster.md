My wife just got her account and she found it awesome; as she was able to catch up on old friends. A highschool buddy paid us a visit today and she too told me to get a Friendster account and you know, start catching up as well (she'd rather that I find out about my batch's whereabouts by myself than get bugged by me). So if you're a buddy of mine, add me to your 300+ node network of friends, jon dot doblados at gmail dot com.
