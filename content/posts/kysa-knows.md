Well here are a couple of shots of our princess, who was trying to finish off her purchases so she can brush teeth and sleep already. She's tried doing some blogging in her spare time (I think this is a good thing for her) and you can follow her [here](http://kysa.doblados.net "Kysa Knows").

Nomnomnom! First shot settings were F/7.1, ISO-400, shutter speed of 0.81sec

Next shot used F/2.8, ISO-400, and shutter speed of 1/10sec. The better shot I think.
