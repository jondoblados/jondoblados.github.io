i'm really hoping my old server gets up soon so i can download my shit out and start publishing again from our own servers here. all my scripts and applications that have been published are there, and most of the updates i did are there. the server went out even before i could sync my local copies. dumbass right? like why in the world would you be doing sync from a remote? ah, but i was "live" editing...which is very very bad, imo.  
  
anyway, here's to hoping i can ssh back to that server again within the week. arghh!
