Finally had a little time in my hands, ergo some updates. One week down. Queen city of the South. Torrential rains. I couldn't be any more bushed than I currently am right now. Moving residence is definitely top in my list for most strenuous activities one can go through. It's very prolonged; and the chores you thought you'd never do again, like wiring the aircon _(Aside: among other things, and did I just forget about the aircon frame that we hacked??)_, well...you end up doing them anyway. It's by God's grace that I haven't felt the flu creeping in yet. Maybe it'll never get the chance to.

Special thanks go to my in-laws, who went with us and carried some of our hand-carried items, to Papa Jun, who's always ready to pick us up from the port whenever we're in the area, _(Aside: guess what, we're settling down here, but I still hope he'd keep doing this until I get a car to do this myself...soon.)_ and to my parents and brother, who lent us a few (and very important) items to get us by while I pay off the fridge and aircon.

Papa's out of practice. It's funny because it seemed like we changed roles already; him assisting me. I'm thankful he stayed up late just to make sure we finished wiring the darn thing. It was so stiffling hot and we needed some cooling so we'd get to sleep already.

Anyway, I'm up to my neck with work already. It's just one project for now, but I'm still trying to adjust to a predominantly Windoze environment. I got a go-ahead from the boss, so I'm going GNULinux over the weekend. Bliss!
