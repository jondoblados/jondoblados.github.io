I love my wife. She's all about the greater levels of thoughtfulness  
that I don't have, and earlier today, she's outdone herself once more.

In a few hours she had completed all of her Christmas shopping for my  
god-children and nephews and nieces. No thanks to me; I couldn't stand  
gift shopping unless it's for her or my kids, much worse if it's for  
some other people.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for giving gifts as long as it's in the  
budget, but man, only my wife can think of what stuff to buy. Where  
was I earlier while my wife was ticking off her shop list? In Roti Mum  
having coffee and buns! Tsk..

My daughter also got bought some clothes and I can see that she's very  
happy with them. Oh well, that's supermom for you!
