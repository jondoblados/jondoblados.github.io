Last July 20, we had our Diversity and Inclusion event for women, which we called "Empowering Women on the Go". We worked with a local JCI chapter, JCI Bai Lawanen, and their members were able to listen to Harriet Fernandez, a director for an IT unit at Xavier University, and Shayryl Mae Ramos, a learning management system administrator, also at Xavier University.  
  
The workshop was on Google Drive and on being able to balance work and home roles. The attendees were able to get great tips from the speakers and were able to see how Google Drive may be able to help improve their lives; as entrepreneurs, as mothers, as women.  
  
Thank you JCI Bai Lawanen, through President Zeanette Jo Cuevas, for helping make this event a success!
