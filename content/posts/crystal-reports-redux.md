I didn't think I'd be saying this many years down the road, but here goes anyway. Crystal Reports is my friend. Yep. Apparently, I've forgotten my disdain for this piece of software. It's amusing (well, for me) that the last version of Crystal Reports that I used for the systems I developed back in the late 90s, is the same version I was forced to use last week, in modifying an old report template.  
  
Some old versions of software refuse to die primarily because many of the enterprise systems that continue to run today rely on output templates that can only be created or modified with very specific software versions. It's no wonder there are still many "indispensable" legacy systems out there.  
  
Now I wish I can say the same for plain RTF templatesÂ + Oracle Business Intelligence.
