i haven't been updating for several important, albeit lousy reasons.

work has been keeping me up at nights and i feel that if i were to write entries, i wouldn't be making much sense.

technobabble is fun, but i've long outgrown this preference for writing. call it a maturing of sorts, and i'm now ready to take things (read: blogging) to higher levels

i've almost completely forgotten about deepest sender, a cool firefox [extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1811) for blogging, and it's great to be using it again
