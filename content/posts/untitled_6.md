nuthin new...i still got sPrOcK up to my neck trying to fix wut went wrong with the servers over the holidays. why do unwanted things have to happen when nobody's in the office? :D  
  
happy three kings! whoopeee for Philippine politics! thanks to the upcoming elections, my job is starting to sound like a lost cause or sumthin. my wife's about done with her nursing anyway, but it'll be another 2 years or so before she can go anywhere; unless some hospital needs a nutritionist/dietician first, nurse second...then maybe, just maybe...it'll be a lot earlier.  
  
can't get jakarta-tomcat-5.0.16 to cooperate with apache...or IIS. the connectors i needed aren't coming off the racks as nightly builds anymore. hahaaay...anyway, i wouldn't be advocating open source if i didn't believe in it so...imma shut my trap now hehe...
