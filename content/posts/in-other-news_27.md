I’ve gone impulsive again. I was waiting for a good time to make this personal (more or less) blog, public.   But then I realize that I may have just been waiting for my hair to grow back.  Believe me, that’s going to take much, much longer!

  

I may as well chronicle everything now that my kids are growing up.  I also think that I and my wife are now going through that most interesting phase of life, and it’s probably worth writing about.  Nothing related to midlife crisis yet, thank God, but definitely worth sharing.

  

All of my tech posts are now on [tech.doblados.net](http://tech.doblados.net "aggregated thinking") (about time!!) Do you think it’s better this way?
