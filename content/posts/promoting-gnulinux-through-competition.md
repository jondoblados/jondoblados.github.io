Met up with [hardwyrd](http://baudizm.blogsome.com) last night for preliminary competition planning. Also present were some of the pillars of GNU/Linux and FOSS in Northern Mindanao: Mr. Rem Taga of MPSC, Mr. Botp Pe√±a of DMPC, and Mr. Vidor Balbon of Philcom. I hope to keep up with these guys considering that my GNU/Linux experience is so diversified and I'd have to polish skills on specific services, some of which I've not even bothered tinkering with. Can you say Dovecot or Cyrus?
