The coming finals in my e-commerce class got me browsing through piles of readings and notes and I realized that I have not fully appreciated e-commerce as I should have. A techie will know what digital signatures, catalogs, EDI's, EFT's, shopping carts, or SSL are, as applied to buying and selling online; but graduate school won't even let you wallow in those. Instead, one gets tasked to relate e-commerce with business processes, and usually, look for solutions to support business processes that e-commerce systems can't support.  
  
TODO: a) Finish schematic diagram of a typical e-commerce (server/merchant client/customer setup), b) complete customizations on osCommerce, c) harden authentication module, d) re-read security framework paper
