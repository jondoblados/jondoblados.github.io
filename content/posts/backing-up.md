Ok, so I griped earlier about failing at being an early adopter. Just when I thought something wouldn’t launch and I turn my back, everyone else then starts getting on it and using it. :p

  

So maybe I’ll just delete my old LJ account and start ranting here, for real. My Posterous account would then be a photoblog of sorts, since I can post directly to it via Gravity on my phone.

  

But a part of me wants to keep my LJ account…for posterity…bragging rights if you want to call it that. Connie would be real proud. After all, she was the one who got me into blogging back in the late 90s. Bwehehe!
