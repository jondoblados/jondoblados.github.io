I have been trying to find time to install Emacs (temporarily) on jjd because I really want to get my planner running asap. It's a good thing that there is currently a good following for this editor, especially when add-on functionality is introducted: like [PlannerMode](http://sacha.free.net.ph), which I believe will be a very good tool for me. It will allow the conception of collaborative input/development for tasks and projects.  
  
TODO:  

  
*   1\. Install Emacs. On Ubuntu or any Debian-based distribution of Linux, type "apt-get install emacs21". On Windows, download and unpack the fullbin archive from `http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/emacs-21.3-fullbin-i386.tar.gz` (Unpack with Winzip/WinRAR).
  
*   2\. Start Emacs.
  
*   3\. Make a directory for your Emacs Lisp files. Could be `~/elisp` or `C:elisp`, or something like that.
  
*   4\. Download the stable version of Planner from `http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/sacha-stable.tar.gz`. Unpack this in Emacs Lisp directory. Directories will be: `~/elisp/emacs-wiki`, `~/elisp/planner`, and `~/elisp/remember`.
  
*   5\. Read through the instructions at `http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerModeQuickStart`  
    or the documentation at `http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/doc/dev/planner/planner-el.html` .
  

  
  
Sacha concurs with several other developers I know, in that Emacs is actually less intimidating than most people think it is. The bigger concern here now is getting the right time in space for playing around with Emacs.
