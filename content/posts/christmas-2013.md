We decided to go to Cebu and spend Christmas this year with my parents and brother. I suppose it has been more than 15 years since we last celebrated Christmas together. The trip was really stressful because it was passenger season. But it was really worth lugging heavy bags since the cousins got to goof off and have a lot of fun, and the grandparents got to see all of their grandchildren in one place.  
  
I've included most of the pictures I've taken with my phone in the gallery below. The first few ones are some of the auto-awesomed pics generated by Google. These animated gifs are posted full-size because Wordpress strips off the frames when it generates the smaller versions of these pictures. After having seen these in one place, I now wish I took more burst shots, especially the ones with Papa and Mama. I guess they'll have to be content with the non-animated regular pictures.
