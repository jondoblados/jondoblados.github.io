aight, this is probably the last time i'm gonna be changing accounts here. i'm getting too old for this poppin' syndrome, and i just hope that all of my friends (parang andami noh? hehe) would understand. i want to re-establish, re-build, and put some stability naman to my entries. meantime, imma wait till i finish archiving (nyek...parang andami din noh?) my previous journals, which i will then delete for closure.  
  
it's almost lunch i better be heading for home. it's supposed to be a no-work day today pero i don't have any qualms...kahit half-day lang at least it pays. di bah kownie?? :)  
  
peace...
