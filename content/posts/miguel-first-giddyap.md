Spur of the moment thing. I was never really good with "anticipation" so didn't take a better recording gadget with us. We didn't think Miguel was going to point at the carousel since he would normally ignore this. I guess he's starting to appreciate things around him more, now that he's walking...and running...and stumbling.
