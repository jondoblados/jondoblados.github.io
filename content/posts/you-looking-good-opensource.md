opensource gets another breakthrough today, as [canonical](http://canonical.com) [launches](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9048520&intsrc=news_ts_head) launchpad personal package archive (PPA), an ubuntu linux developers service intended to extend collaboration in software development and give the community equal opportunity to build and package code for [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) on the desktop, server, and for mobile applications.

great news for those itching to modify packages and contribute to the furtherance of opensource! users can make changes on packages of their choice, and these will be published in the PPA system, somewhat like a special repository.

aptly, users get the updates from the system whenever new versions of the packages become available.
