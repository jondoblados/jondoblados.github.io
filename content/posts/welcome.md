There's a bunch of new templates on Blogger now. The last time I checked in 2009, there were just the old themes that sort of grow old on you faster than gym socks.  
  
My only gripe is that getting all of my posts imported from a Wordpress platform is rather difficult. I'm tempted to just start from a clean slate, but I have tons of notes from my old posts and I'd like to see them all from one site.
