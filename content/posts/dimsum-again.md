We love Dimsum Diner, but we gotta start learning to keep ourselves from eating there too often. Why? We're all high risk people, that's why.  
  
In this set, my sister-in-law was playing around with the camera settings, which explains the no-flash feature. Will try to do another shoot next time and will play with ISO and WB. Not a DSLR. Lugging that with us during family eat-outs is overkill.
