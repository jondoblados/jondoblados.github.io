There's a pretty slick Windows application that will allow you to post directly to your Blogger Beta account. The Firefox extension [Deepest Sender](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1811/), which allows posting to LJ, Blogger, and Wordpress, doesn't work with Blogger Beta yet, so here's a [workaround](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!757.entry) that you can do meantime.

I prefer FOSS applications that run natively on GNU/Linux, but sometimes, you really need to use a platform where you are most productive. Writing stuff from anywhere will mean doing this from my Windows-run notebook. Not so much an issue, I hope.
