(YIKES!) guess where she landed hard with both her feet?<p />anyway, after the initial shocking pain (like when u get ur balls kicked), i figured it didn't really cause that much damage since i hardly felt anything the following day. well sunday came and i found myself weeping trying to get myself to piss. imagine standing five minutes over the commode waiting for that usual stream to come out, but cant because it felt like pissing razors (if i can please use that for comparison).<p />okay, the doctor tells me it's just some bruising (daw), but i read: "major contusion in the ingrinal? area [you try reading a doctor's handwriting] due to blunt trauma" in my med. cert. so who's worried?<p />plenty of water and anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxing drugs are doing wonders. my friend got bitten by a stray cat the other day and i was like "uh-huh", but really, i'm glad she's getting shots for those. u really can't tell when they're stray. especially cats. that's why i stick with the dogs. :P<br/><br/><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/kysapop/889.html">5 comments</a><br/><hr /><br/>New Life, New Name<br/>[Dec. 16th, 2002|<b>02:46 pm</b>]<br/><b>Current Mood</b> | <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><br/><img alt="Media_httpstatlivejou_pgbbp" height="40" src="http://jon.doblados.net/wp-content/uploads/2003/09/media_httpstatlivejou_pGBBp.gif" width="40" /><br/></div><br/> horny<br/><br/>I have a lot of things to say, and I have a lot of explaining to do. Nevertheless, I'll start this off by thanking Kakai for letting me know that LJ's still around. I'm thinking of reposting my last three entries (like I had more than 3) for nostalgia, but I guess it's always better to start all over again.<p />So why the nick change? My life's revolving around my family now -- my wife, and my daughter. We call our little girl Kysa, so the nick kysapop's etymology is probably as unique as that.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/kysapop/321.html">3 comments</a>
