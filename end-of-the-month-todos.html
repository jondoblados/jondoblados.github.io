</div>

<p>I have again changed the look of my tech blog. I've actually mulled over
this for quite some time since I was also thinking of just moving
everything to my own hosted Wordpress install. But, lazy as I am, I was
content to tweak as little as I can. Posterous has a few really nice
themes built-in so moving my stuff out was really a bad idea.</p>
<p>In case you're curious, here are some of the things that I intend to
complete this month:</p>
<p>​1. Finish half of my self-imposed OpenStack Compute reading assignment.
Oh wait, that wouldn't be half, since I intend to test run an OpenStack
Compute instance. :p</p>
<p>​2. With my buddy Romar, complete and deploy a hosting infrastructure
over AWS, using of all things, Pound as a proxy, with lots of small and
micro EC2 instances serving data from a single, extra large and
high-memory RDS instance.</p>
<p>​3. Upgrade the main EC2 instance where Pound lives so it can take a
beating. I will most likely do some tests with the actual traffic in
order to determine if Pound is memory or CPU extensive; and this will
help me decide which type of instance to upgrade to later on.</p>
<p>​4. Upload one of my audio rants as a podcast. My being slightly OC
doesn't help at all, really. I got half a mind wanting to redo them.</p>
<p>​5. Complete a custom theme for my wife's food blog. Yeah, I owe her big
time. Maybe I ought to bump this up to #1.</p>
<p>If you do stuff like I do, I'd be glad to hear from you.</p>
