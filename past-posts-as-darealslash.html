		<p>Yaaaaaaah!!! I burned myself with my own cig butt! Sheesh. Don't
underestimate the butt. Surely, it'll want to get back at u after u've
used it, (kaw kaya sipsipin at paglaruan dyan!) even more if u don't
thank it for at least serving its purpose!</p>
<p>My wife's giving birth anyday now and I'm just sooooo excited! Huh? Am I
ready u mean? To be a father yes but frankly, we don't have everything
ready for the baby; y'know, the post natal stuff u need to have. Tsk!
Tag-hirap chong!</p>
<p>Who says u have to be a politician or an actor so u could stay in the
delivery room too? Dammit! If that were true then where's the fun? Sorry
muh dearest wife, I know it aint fun pushing and laboring, but hey...
those movies of husbands sticking with their wifes show a kind of
elation that I wanna feel first-hand! Screw the rules! :P</p>
<p>What's the strongest anti-migraine, over the counter drug u know? I got
a bout yesterday and got bedridden almost the whole day. It's still
trying to creep back as I type this; nothing seems to work anymore!</p>
<p>I tried some drug here in the office (which my boss gave to one
co-employee) and it worked a bit. Must be a downer. ?!*@&amp;\^</p>
<p>I lost my lighter again!  </p>

<p><strong>Monday, March 5th, 2001</strong>  </p>
<p>I saw the accident over at Guadalupe between two airconditioned buses
yesterday. I've never seen so much shattered, more like powdered,
automotive glass on the street. Twisted metal, the rescue squad (btw, I
think they're a little too OA; like they're so much into their roles
that they almost look like they're in some action flick...well, ok, it's
their ballpark but hey, I'd have that FEEL of authority anytime!), and I
think I saw blood but I was too uuhhh...giddy, yeah sumthin like that,
to even take a closer look.</p>
<p>It felt weird; I'm not exactly thrilled about the idea of gory things,
much more see blood in places other than the wet market, but you know
it's not supposed to be there!</p>
<p>I would've taken the bus to Nova. There's one route that'll drop me
right outside our village but decided not to. My innards were still
churning so I rode the MRT instead.</p>
<p>Next time you decide to patronize public transport, check out the
driver! That driver who went splat against the MRT wall looked sabog daw
and decided to scare the other bus by flicking its tail. Careened out of
control and went for the swatter! Perfect 10!</p>
<p>And don't ride the buses when it's so late at night or so early in the
morning! You won't get to choose which bus to ride anymore and at those
hours, EDSA turns into a racetrack!</p>
<p>I know, tarantado rin akong magdrive but one good look at how graphic
the last scene is is now making me hesitate a lot before I can even step
hard on the gas.  </p>

<strong>First dip, I may have found my non-reactive sounding board</strong>  </p>
<p>Hey Kai! Thanks a lot for leading me here. I could have used this a
loooonnggg time ago!</p>
<p>Cooling my heels in the office (yeah, I KNOW walang OT d2 but dammit!);
can't go home and stare at the ceiling. I'd probably just get da urge to
txt her. Don't want to anymore, not for a week I guess. I txtd 2K
messages in one billing period! Felt like kicking myself.</p>
<p>So I went through this whole you-look-glum-what's-wrong? routine and
nobody seemed to notice here. Hah! Probably because they never see me
wearing some other face!  </p>
