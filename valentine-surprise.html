		<p>Each year, on Valentine's day, I usually surprise my darling wife with a
letter/card, or a bouquet of roses. As it was a yearly thing, I knew she
sort of expected these surprises; she'd look surprised, but I knew she
wasn't really. Occasionally, she does get surprised. Like that time back
in Cebu when I bought her a rather intricate bouquet of flowers. Her
head spun when she found out how much I paid for it. Surprise!  </p>
<p>This year, however, is different. I was not able to prepare anything for her.
I didn't get her anything, thinking that I'd just make up for it with
dinner, or something. Yes, I didn't plan for this and I feel lousy
actually. Last night, after my daughter gave me and my wife her
home-made Valentine greeting cards, my wife started chiding me about
what I was going to give her the next day. I gave her my usual "I'm not
telling" smile and silently kicked myself. I wished I already had
something ready, and I found myself already longing for the anticipation
of the surprise's revelation.</p>
<p>Obviously, I've already fallen off the bus-called-state-of-preparedness, and my chances of springing a surprise
is not looking good. But during this morning's rush, my wife told me to
look at my backpack and I got a shock. Sticking out of the front pocket
was what clearly looked like greeting card. I pulled out the card from
its envelope, opened it, read what she wrote on it, looked at her, and
saw her give me that knowing smile. It was her turn to surprise
me.</p>
<p>I thank God for this experience. It reminds me that no matter the
circumstance, all things turn for good. Far from being a perfect
relationship, it is by faith that we've persisted in believing in God's
plans and promises for us. And ultimately, it is by His grace that we
were given this great relationship to enjoy. I was too concerned with
the fact that I did not have anything prepared for this day. God reminds
me that more than surprises, and more than how the world celebrates
Valentine's day, it is the relationships that He affords and blesses me
that I must nurture and be thankful for. <em>"The Lord is righteous in all
his ways and faithful in all he does" (Psalm 145:17).</em></p>
<p>How awesome it is to have Him who is all-faithful to back you up!</p>
