      <p>Over the Holy Week, two of our home computer's drives crashed, probably
due to extensive user download, software installs, and malware. I had to
do work on the laptop for a while, and since everyone in the house was
itching for Internet access, I brought in a small IDE drive (roughly
around 9Gb) that was mounted as slave on my office computer and popped
that in the home computer. I had more than enough reasons to put Ubuntu
back in there, and nobody would be complaining!</p>
<p>Initially, I did a Breezy install and got all the needed packages up
to-date. I wanted more so I changed all "breezy" references to "dapper"
in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>, and did <code>sudo apt-get update</code>, and
<code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code>.
<abbr title="If I Remember Correctly">IIRC</abbr>, a total of 940+
packages had to be updated over an estimated 4 and a half hours. I left
the computer running overnight, woke up at around 2 am and finished the
installs and configurations.</p>
<p>By morning, my wife, daughter, and sister-in-law, were able to use the
computer for Internet surfing. I was able to recover their personal
documents and multimedia files in the office; and just last night
uploaded their files via an external USB-mounted hard drive that we use
for mobile backups at work.</p>
<p>I just love Dapper! The default Human theme's colors and icons just
totally rawk, and for a while, I didn't feel the need to install another
theme. Well my kid really likes Gartoon, and since her gcompris theme is
already in Gartoon, I installed that theme as well.</p>
<p>Mark Shuttleworth posted an announcement last night on planning
Dapper+1. He divulged that the codename for the next release would be
the "Edgy Eft", saying that:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edgy is all about cutting edge, perhaps bleeding edge,<br />
brand new code and infrastructure. It will be the right time to bring
in<br />
some seriously interesting but definitely edgy new technologies which<br />
lay the groundwork for the next wave of Ubuntu development.<br />
</p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "bleeding edge" phrase is so Fedora Core, but IMO, Ubuntu won't be
like that in any way. Mark did say they were going to explore slightly
unfamiliar territory that is out of the mainstream. This controlled
exploration of technology will definitely bring Ubuntu as a GNU/Linux
distribution to very, very high levels. The good stuff is just around
the corner: Xen for virtualization (awesome GPLed technology that
<a href="http://jondoblados.blogspot.com/rimuhosting.com">rimuhosting.com</a> has been using for years!), multi-architecture
support, and the XGL that blows away just about everyone.</p>
<p>To infinity, and beyond!</p>

      <p>I had the opportunity to spend a few days vacationing in Manila. My
mom-in-law was attending a national conference for pediatricians, and
was given travel sponsorships for the entire family. I jumped at the
chance to visit my aging Lola because she had not seen her great
granddaughter, as the case was with all of my
<abbr title="Quezon City">QC</abbr>-based relatives. Our itinerary was
real tight, but I was happy anyway since we went through so many
unexpected, yet pleasant surprises en route to Manila until we got back
here.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>My wife and I have this "kapatid sa labas" or step-sibling of sorts, who
we used to work with in Allegro, back in Makati. He's now a flight
steward for this nation's flag carrier, and he was on our
<abbr title="Cagayan de Oro">CDO</abbr>-<abbr title="Manila">MLA</abbr>
flight. I tried to give him a hard time by complaining about the (his)
service, but he outmaneuvered me, as my wife and I had to contend with
hand carried baggage, which he had insisted that we stow away under the
seat in front of us. It was a good thing that the life vest demo was on
video, otherwise I might've laughed my gut out the whole time. Blah. It
really was great having bumped into him again. My daughter remembered
him too!  </p>
<p>We stayed at the Dusit Hotel Nikko; posh, yes, but this selection wasn't
ours. It was mostly creditable to the auspices of my mom-in-law, who has
great PR with the pharma companies, by the way. So the plan was to
settle in, do some shopping, steal the van for a day and visit grandma,
and spend the rest of the days doing more shopping. Now this didn't
exactly go as planned since mom needed the van, so we went to
Novaliches, QC, straight from the airport.  </p>
<p>Our house in Novaliches, QC, seemed to have gotten real small over the
years. It must be because since my grandma stopped working on the
garden, all sorts of plants have occupied what available space there
was. I saw several monitor lizards darting in and out of the shrubs. I
guess they were as eager to keep cool in Manila's unbelievably stiffling
heat. Lola Magding didn't immediately recognize me, but I was happy she
did eventually; and she cried as usual when someone close to her comes
to pay her a visit. I was even happier that she remembered Pangga.
Naturally, her "apo-sa-tuhod" got smothered with hugs and kisses, much
to the latter's irritation.  </p>
<p>After lunch, Pangga, Aunt Fe, and Aunt Dodang talked a lot. Kysa got
along with her Uncle Brian (5'10" at 13 years, and he was just a runt
when I last saw him) and the helpers, and they were doing their stuff.
My Uncle Arnold and I did a one-on-one; not like how it was when Uncle
Boy was still around, but yeah, two's a quorum and will definitely do.
You do know how catching up drinking sessions work, right?  </p>
<p>That night, we were back at the hotel and did checks on the itinerary.
Monday was to be spent for taking care of Pangga's LTO certification at
the Tayuman agency. It was pretty far from where we were, but it helped
that we were able to borrow a car for the trip. LTO surprised me that
day. I didn't see the kind of transactions that I used to see. Everyone
was being quite helpful and appeared to be no-nonsense in their
dealings. We got the certification we needed in under 30 minutes! Wow.
Talk about fixing up. The afternoon was spent going around
Market-Market, a vast shopping area that I swear I'll never visit again
unless necessary. We met up with Mareng Lilay, Pangga's closest friend,
Kysa's Ninang, co-worker at the Allegro, and now big time manager at
Teriyaki Boy. Why do they get sweetest jobs? Don't get me wrong, I'll
code anytime for food (and beer).  </p>
<p>We went to Enchanted Kingdom the following day and pigged out and rode
all we could. I wanted to try out the space shuttle ride, since it
wasn't around the last time, or maybe I just didn't see it back then.
Big disappointment. Nobody wanted to ride with me and I hated riding
alone, so I missed out on that one. I'll catch that ride next time, or
maybe some other fast and crazy ride in HK!  </p>
<p>On our last day, I met up with Carl, a high school buddy and one of my
closest friends. We did some catching up over lunch, coffee, and Lights.
<em>Bong, bilib ako sa iyo tsong, kasi kahit anong mangyari, kahit papaano,
inaangat mo ang pamilya mo at sarili mo sa wasto</em>. To hell with those
who righteously think they're better than you are!  </p>
<p>I was also able to meet up with Ubunteros <a href="http://clair.free.net.ph/">Clair</a>, <a href="http://jmibanez.livejournal.com/">JM</a>, <a href="http://thegeekettespeaketh.pinoyweb.net/">Charo</a>,
and <a href="http://blog.ealden.net/">Ealden</a>. They're all real cool people! Clair and JM compose one
of the sweetest couples I've seen. They're really a great match. Charo,
well...Charo...nevermind. She's well, disappointing. I was expecting to
get scared off my socks with her patent claws and green wasabi for a
brain. :P But no, she's real cool and very nice naman pala! Ealden's
very "in demand" as he had his thoughts on coming interviews. Panicky?
Not! But it's obvious that he can bowl over any interviewer with his
skills and his looks..nyarharhar! As I've been eating most of the time,
I said I just wanted coffee. Ealden needed a chow real bad (overslept,
ergo skipped meals; tsk) so we shuffled to Big Buddha at the Greenbelt.
Surprise! Like our "kapatid" and "kumare", the manager of that
restaurant used to be a co-worker at Allegro!  </p>
<p>I'm really happy that in spite of the tight schedule, we were able to do
everything we needed and wanted to do; well, almost. :)</p>

      <p>It's so dissapointing to see CSS that you really like "unrenderable" in
IE. All I can say is get Firefox now!</p>
