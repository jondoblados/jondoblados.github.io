> As we increased the number of sockets each socket’s buffers increased

> On a standard EC2 Small, the configuration is such that the LOWMEM is

> about reallocating LOWMEM for the user, but not the other way around.
> The assumption is that the kernel will use very little ram, or at
> least a predictable finite amount, and the user should be allowed to
> go crazy. What we needed with our socket server was just the opposite.

> On a 32-bit system the kernel-addressable RAM space is 4GB. Making

> 64-bit (x86-64) Linux the [kernel-addressable space is 64TB
> (terabytes)][]. At the current state of computing this is effectively

> So we created some EC2 Large instances (each of which is 64-bit with

> options we’ve modified.
>
>   
>
> First is `fs.file-max`, the maximum file descriptor limit. The default
> is quite low so this should be adjusted. Be careful if you’re not
> ready to go super high.
>
>   
>
> Second, we have the socket buffer parameters `net.ipv4.tcp_rmem` and
> `net.ipv4.tcp_wmem`. These are the buffers for reads and writes
> respectively. Each requires three integer inputs: min, default, and
> max. These each correspond to the number of bytes that may be buffered
> for a socket. Set these low with a tolerant max to reduce the amount
> of ram used for each socket.

Priority Inbox^Beta^

</div>

<p>Welcome to Priority Inbox! By automatically separating out your most
important messages, Priority Inbox makes it easy for you to read and
respond to the messages that matter.</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 130%; clear: both;">Get through your email faster</h1>

Try reading and replying to the messages in the "Important and Unread"
section first. Mark anything that requires follow-up with a star, then
go through the "Everything Else" section. If you leave Priority Inbox,
you can return to it by clicking the link next to Inbox on the side
navigation of Gmail.




How it works {style="font-size: 130%;"}
============



Gmail's servers look at several types of information to identify the
email that's important to you, including who you email and chat with
most, how often you email with these people, and which keywords appear
frequently in the emails you read.

<p>If Priority Inbox makes a mistake, you can use the ![Mark important][]
![Mark not important][] buttons to correctly mark a conversation as
important or not important, and Priority Inbox will quickly learn what
you care about most.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Customize Priority Inbox:</strong> You can change what type of email you
    see in each section (like switching the "Important and Unread"
    section to just "Important"). Just click on the section headers or
    visit the Priority Inbox tab under [Settings][] and choose to
    "customize inbox groups."</li>
<li><strong>Use filters to guarantee importance:</strong> If you want to be
    absolutely sure that some messages are always marked as important
    (like email from your boss), you can [set up a filter][] and choose
    "Always mark it as important."</li>
<li><strong>Search by importance:</strong> If you want to see all the messages that
    have been marked as important, both read and unread, do a Gmail
    search for "is:important."</li>
<li><strong>Switching back to your old inbox:</strong> If Priority Inbox isn't for
    you, you can easily switch back to your normal inbox by clicking
    "Inbox" on the left or hide Priority Inbox altogether from Gmail
    [Settings][].</li>
</ul>
