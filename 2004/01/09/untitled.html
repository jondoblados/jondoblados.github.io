onyks: just a thought, man. thought i'd let u and other open-source advocates read this. :)<br/><br/>Mr. Richard Stallman in his article: <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/software/04/01/05/1146229.shtml?tid=150&amp;tid=82">The Free Software Community After 20 Years: With great but incomplete success, what now?</a> said, and i quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>"If you take as your goal the increased popularity of certain free software, if you seek to convince more people to use some free programs some of the time, you might think those non-free program are helpful contributions to that goal. It is hard to dispute the claim that their availability helps make GNU/Linux more popular. If the widespread use of GNU or Linux is the ultimate goal of our community, we should logically applaud all applications that run on it, whether free or not.<br/><br/>But if our goal is freedom, that changes everything. Users cannot be free while using a non-free program. To free the citizens of cyberspace, we have to replace those non-free programs, not accept them. They are not contributions to our community, they are temptations to settle for continuing non-freedom."</i></blockquote><br/><br/>great, huh? let's get that advocacy thingie started! :D
