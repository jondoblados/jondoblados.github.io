watched the CSI premiere last night (yea, i guess Asia's only watching the new season episodes now, thanks AXN!) and couldn't get enough of it! (as usual) lolz. it was a bit frustrating though to see "To Be Continued..." at the end....lolz. it was a refreshing reprise of the kind of forensic shows we've gotten so used of, thanks to jerry bruckheimer. let's face it, CSI paved the way for real and "authentic" forensics for the layman. more, more!!!<br/><br/>CSI Miami was okay, di ko lang feel ung actors. lolz. yea, i'm very very biased. now if someone can tell me what the rerun skeds are...
