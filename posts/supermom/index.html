  <h1>Supermom</h1>
  <p>I love my wife. She&rsquo;s all about the greater levels of thoughtfulness that I don&rsquo;t have, and earlier today, she&rsquo;s outdone herself once more.</p>
<p>In a few hours she had completed all of her Christmas shopping for my god-children and nephews and nieces. No thanks to me; I couldn&rsquo;t stand gift shopping unless it&rsquo;s for her or my kids, much worse if it&rsquo;s for some other people.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m all for giving gifts as long as it&rsquo;s in the budget, but man, only my wife can think of what stuff to buy. Where was I earlier while my wife was ticking off her shop list? In Roti Mum having coffee and buns! Tsk..</p>
<p>My daughter also got bought some clothes and I can see that she&rsquo;s very happy with them. Oh well, that&rsquo;s supermom for you!</p>
