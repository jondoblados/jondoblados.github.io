  <h1>Will code for hosting</h1>
  <p>Honestly, I haven&rsquo;t done any coding in the last 4 months, which is really odd, because I never thought I&rsquo;d be this detached from programming. But I guess there&rsquo;s more to life than just developing or sustaining passion for singulars. So much for trying not to stay generalist.</p>
<p>So I have this personal domain now, and I&rsquo;m just glad google apps isn&rsquo;t as stiff with the applications anymore. The new interface totally rocks too. I just need to host the domain somewhere, for sites and blogs and stuff.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re family, and you have a blogger account, I can get you your custom domain working. The default blogspot.com publishing URL will redirect to your custom domain, so I guess you won&rsquo;t be losing any visitors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that sure about this, but I feel that there will be noticeable changes in how your blog fares with SE&rsquo;s. Some SEO stuff that I&rsquo;ve picked up tell me you can&rsquo;t have same content in multiple sites, similar to double-posting. Seems like you can get penalized for that. Question is, will the application of this redirecting exercise on blog a (that has already been indexed) be seen as same content with blog b (which is where blog a will redirect to, if and only if you decide on a custom domain), from a search engine&rsquo;s view?</p>
<p>Anyway, I need a host. :) Ironically, I handle dozens of hosts; but I can&rsquo;t get anywhere close to those (all dedicated servers..boohoohoo) without first coughing up lots of cash. Yea I suppose I could just code for it.</p>
