  <h1>Using non-standard SSH port with TortoiseSVN</h1>
  <p>Some of my students reported that they were having problems connecting to their repositories using <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>. At first, quick checks from my end didn&rsquo;t reveal what caused these, but I realized soon that it wasn&rsquo;t a server issue. It seems like the client software that they were using (TortoiseSVN) didn&rsquo;t know what to make of the <code>svn+ssh://[user]@[ip]:[port]/[repo]</code> URL.</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.rabbitvcs.org/">RabbitVCS</a> on my Linux boxen and get the same &ldquo;Network connection closed unexpectedly&rdquo; message. A colleague at work suggested that since a non-standard port for SSH is used, I should modify my <code>/home/&lt;username&gt;/.subversion/config</code> , look for the [tunnels] section, and append <code>-p [port number]</code> for the svn tunnel named ssh. Since this particular repository is just one among the dozens I access, I can&rsquo;t modify the default svn tunnel. Instead, I added a custom tunnel for each of the servers that use non-standard SSH ports.</p>
<p>For the repo that my students were trying to access, I used <code>ssh2212 = $SVN_SSH ssh -q -o ControlMaster=no -p 2212</code>. So the URL now looks like <code>svn+ssh2212://[user]@[ip]:2212/[repo]</code> and I was able to connect successfully.</p>
<p>In Windows, there are several ways to do this. Since the OS doesn&rsquo;t have a native SSH client executable, users will rely on Cygwin, Putty, or on TortoisePlink.exe (in newer versions of TortoiseSVN).</p>
<p>You can try any of the following solutions (they&rsquo;re all searchable in the Internets) and see if you can get around the problem. I&rsquo;ve tried them all on a Windows guest OS on VirtualBox and only the last three solutions worked.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using Putty: Use saved session name from Putty in the URL: <code>svn+ssh://[user]@[saved putty session name]/[repo]</code>. Make sure that you configure the session to already use the correct port.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Putty: Alternately, use <code>IP:port</code> format for the Putty saved session name so that you still use the <code>svn+ssh://[user]@[ip]:[port]/[repo]</code> URL format, but you&rsquo;re actually calling the saved session name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c. Using client packaged with Tortoise. In TortoiseSVN settings -&gt; Network, change SSH client to <code>&quot;C:Program FilesTortoiseSVNbinTortoisePlink.exe&quot;</code> and use standard <code>svn+ssh://[user]@[ip]:[port]/[repo]</code> URL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>d. Same as d., but for the SSH client, append <code>-P [port number]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>e. Using a wrapper script, such as the one provided <a href="http://unformatt.com/news/non-standard-ssh-ports-with-tortoise-svn/">here</a> (excellent solution btw), and use it as the SSH client executable in TortoiseSVN settings -&gt; Network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope any one of these work for you. As an inside joke from one of my sysad friends, it was also suggested that I save myself the troubles and just log in to the server and revert to the default SSH port. LOL.</p>
