			<p>I got really dissed last night waiting for instructors to report for class. It almost seemed prank-like to me, because we were all waiting for this guy to show up, and just a few minutes before we were afforded a free cut, somebody got SMS from the instructor, apologizing that he wasn&rsquo;t going to make it (again). It probably came late because of network lag, but I&rsquo;d glady discount that because it was a 3-hr class and we waited for almost an hour for the cut.</p>
<p>As I was not used to waiting (and doing nothing), I whipped out my notebook and started scribbling diagrams and policy tables for the firewall I was configuring for the last 3 days. Looking at these notes now, I&rsquo;m glad I did them last night. I came in this morning sort of blank&hellip;and couldn&rsquo;t remember what I did yesterday. Creepy.</p>
<p>Instructors better report tonight!</p>
