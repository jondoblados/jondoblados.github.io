  <h1>Settling down</h1>
  <p>Finally had a little time in my hands, ergo some updates. One week down. Queen city of the South. Torrential rains. I couldn&rsquo;t be any more bushed than I currently am right now. Moving residence is definitely top in my list for most strenuous activities one can go through. It&rsquo;s very prolonged; and the chores you thought you&rsquo;d never do again, like wiring the aircon <em>(Aside: among other things, and did I just forget about the aircon frame that we hacked??)</em>, well&hellip;you end up doing them anyway. It&rsquo;s by God&rsquo;s grace that I haven&rsquo;t felt the flu creeping in yet. Maybe it&rsquo;ll never get the chance to.</p>
<p>Special thanks go to my in-laws, who went with us and carried some of our hand-carried items, to Papa Jun, who&rsquo;s always ready to pick us up from the port whenever we&rsquo;re in the area, <em>(Aside: guess what, we&rsquo;re settling down here, but I still hope he&rsquo;d keep doing this until I get a car to do this myself&hellip;soon.)</em> and to my parents and brother, who lent us a few (and very important) items to get us by while I pay off the fridge and aircon.</p>
<p>Papa&rsquo;s out of practice. It&rsquo;s funny because it seemed like we changed roles already; him assisting me. I&rsquo;m thankful he stayed up late just to make sure we finished wiring the darn thing. It was so stiffling hot and we needed some cooling so we&rsquo;d get to sleep already.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m up to my neck with work already. It&rsquo;s just one project for now, but I&rsquo;m still trying to adjust to a predominantly Windoze environment. I got a go-ahead from the boss, so I&rsquo;m going GNULinux over the weekend. Bliss!</p>
