  <h1>More Plesk Blues</h1>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve had this problem with Plesk since I started relying heavily on it in 2006. For some reason, after you&rsquo;ve added your client, allocated IP address to client&rsquo;s pool, added a domain, and selecting physical hosting, you get the message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unable to update hosting preferences: hosting update is failed: object ID is invalid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After getting this error, you get the domain listed, but still requiring set up. Attempting to complete physical hosting setup will give you same result. First thing you&rsquo;d want to look at would be some log.  For all of its peculiarities, Plesk has an organized directory tree.  Look at <code>/usr/local/psa/admin/logs/httpsd_error_log</code> and you&rsquo;ll see that skeleton or template is missing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know exactly where to get the <code>.skel</code> directory, but some Googling led me to <code>/home/httpd/vhosts/.skel/0</code>, which after some directory skimming, I was able to verify as non-existent.  I simply copied an existing <code>.skel</code> directory from one of our other servers and redid the physical hosting setup.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see if I can find out what&rsquo;s causing the <code>.skel</code> directory to cease to exist. This is a fairly easier to solve issue. I so need to start looking in forums of Parallels (formerly SWSoft) for solutions.</p>
