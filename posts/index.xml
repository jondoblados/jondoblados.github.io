      <title>Goodbye, Facebook</title>

      <description>About a month ago, I started getting reminders to enable Facebook Protect, some feature meant to protect certain people who may be targeted by folks up to no good or even other social media platforms. Meta specifically mentions accounts of politicians or candidates who may require additional protection during elections.
So the funny thing is that I’m no politician, and I barely even post about politics. I avoid doing so as much as I can, for my sanity’s sake, and well, for friendships&amp;rsquo; sake.</description>

      <description>My daughter turns 20 today. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t be any more proud of her. She&amp;rsquo;s been through a lot and though all that, she had her share of victories here and there, like getting her advanced diploma last year, and getting into University this year.You&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way, langga! Know that we will always be here to support you and your goals. Papa, Mama, and Miguel love you very much!</description>

      <title>Uncle Bong in SG</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been over two decades since I last saw Uncle Bong. He would usually drop by Diamond Village in Novaliches, Quezon City to visit Lola Magding and my mother&amp;rsquo;s side of the family there. Back then, I was still in college, and I think he had also just started working, in the automotive industry.
He has since worked in cruise ships and it was a good stroke of fortune when he told me that they would be dry-docking in Singapore.</description>

      <description>Dad and mum, Jen, Rob, Ava, and Rob&amp;rsquo;s parents spent the holidays here in Singapore. For once, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to take that many photos, but everything&amp;rsquo;s been awesome, especially Miguel&amp;rsquo;s and Ava&amp;rsquo;s gift opening.
Luckily, I managed to retrieve some of the most important photos, which are those of dining out! :D</description>

      <description>Dad and Mom dropped by Singapore to celebrate Mae&amp;rsquo;s birthday with us. It was two days of hectic shopping at the IMM, dining out, and cooking for an instant birthday party at the flat with colleagues at work and cousins in SG! Happy birthday, pangga!</description>

      <description>These are some of the pictures I took during the CDO (Cagayan de Oro) and Cebu legs of our 2019 trip to the Philippines. In CDO, we did a joint birthday celebration for our kids since their birthdays are just a week apart. It was a great time to catch up with extended family and friends.
We then flew to Cebu City and spent a couple of days meeting family and close friends.</description>

Credits to Pavex for the great tool. He details out how to use it here.</description>

      <description>Over a year ago, a friend invited me to take on a job in Singapore. Whenever I get asked about working overseas, I&amp;rsquo;d say I&amp;rsquo;d give it some thought. And almost always, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give it any more than that, knowing that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to bear being away from family over extended periods of time.
Fast forward today and I&amp;rsquo;m doing the OFW bit and all, with my family in tow!</description>

      <description>Back in November last year, the Apps Services Partner that I help with Google Apps Support told me that I was required to take the Google Apps for Work Deployment Specialist certification exam. I learned that Google was going to end the certification program and that I had to take the exam January 5, 2016. It turns out that they were simplifying the Partner Credential Program. All good!
So I took a crash review during the holiday break, read through all Google Apps for Work help articles I could get my hands on, and did self-study on Google Apps Administrator Fundamentals and Deployment Essentials.</description>

      <description>In my previous employment, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any problems with submitting reports, practically because we used a time management/monitoring tool and the reports sort of generated by themselves. So when submitting daily reports isn&amp;rsquo;t the norm here at the unit, quarterly reports become quite tricky.I&amp;rsquo;ve resorted to referring to Google Calendar as most of the stuff we do are usually scheduled. I&amp;rsquo;ve also thought of logging everything on a text file and have pelican publish this to my website.</description>

      <description>In a month&amp;rsquo;s time, I would be transferring offices again. I started from a very technical department, under the administration cluster. A year and about 3 months later, I was given the privilege to transfer to one of the most influential and authoritative departments in the academic cluster. It was still a split engagement, with me going back and forth these two offices.
And for almost 2 years, I improved processes, handled, battled, and took care of hundreds of scenarios, cases, and situations that seem to always come with the university seasons.</description>

      <description>By 2016, five higher education institutes (HEIs) here in the Philippines will be integrating Technopreneurship as an offered elective for their Engineering programs. I am quite thankful that the higher education authorities have included my alma mater. More than being the center of trade in Northern Mindanao, the strategic location of our city makes it the best option for I.T. companies to build or expand in.
While the article specifically mentions entrepeneurship training for future engineers and that inclusion will be done in the Engineering curricula of 5 HEIs, I feel that this is severely limiting the beneficiaries (e.</description>

      <title>Apple Announces MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues</title>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t think there was going to be any hope for my early 2011 MacBook Pro, which had GPU-related problems after only about a year of use. The only obvious option I had was to buy a replacement laptop. But Apple seems to have been receiving a lot of reports that they&amp;rsquo;ve launched a repair program that will fix the graphics problem for free.
If you bought a 15-inch or 17-inch MacBook Pro between early 2011 and end of 2013, as well as the first two generations of the Retina models, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck.</description>

      <description>I just made the first step towards moving my whole blog to GitHub and going all static! Content is generated by Pelican, a static site generator, written in Python. Why GitHub, you ask? While I can always push the static content to any of my existing web hosts, there&amp;rsquo;s a touch of geekness in writing using my favorite editor and publishing by git commits and pushes; thus GitHub.
Also, it&amp;rsquo;s this year that I&amp;rsquo;m planning to pick up Python programming again, for devops reasons.</description>

      <title>Racking Legacy Servers - Part 1</title>

      <description>Earlier today we scheduled the racking of our old C-Class HP BladeSystem. It used to be wrapped in its own enclosure with wheels to boot, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to have it stand outside the cabinets. So we gave heads up and asked some guys to stay behind after office hours. Thanks to Mona, Eric, Jing, Tim, and Mark(?) for the assist!
Next up, the classic IBM BladeCenter!</description>

      <description>10 years ago, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be complaining at all. I could live in a datacenter for days until the job&amp;rsquo;s done. But these days, my back aches are more pronounced, and fatigue sets in more easily. This is why it&amp;rsquo;s always great to have others helping out. Thanks to the CISO and PPO teams for making the migrations happen! I may have gotten older but the one thing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t change is the thrill of the job.</description>

      <description>Unlike in the late 90s to mid 2000s, desktop real estate is no longer constrained by the number of monitors you use. We now tout the number of virtual machines we have access to. In fact, my ailing MBP has managed to remain useful because remote access still enables me to work on all our VMs. Our applications and storage servers are all virtualized. Even some legacy systems have been replicated on VMs, allowing us to retire old and bulky server hardware.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d be saying this many years down the road, but here goes anyway. Crystal Reports is my friend. Yep. Apparently, I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten my disdain for this piece of software. It&amp;rsquo;s amusing (well, for me) that the last version of Crystal Reports that I used for the systems I developed back in the late 90s, is the same version I was forced to use last week, in modifying an old report template.</description>

They also played frisbee and volleyball on the village streets and watched scary movies when it got dark. There were lots of food too! I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it was going to be so much fun! Thanks to my dear wife for making preparations, especially the cooking and baking.</description>

      <description>This is our opening salvo for the year. Since we started last year, GBG Cagayan de Oro has been receiving a lot of good feedback from the locals. But we&amp;rsquo;ve put our attention on the areas where we can improve, and I really believe that this mapping event is a step towards that direction. A well-mapped city improves tourism and support services. It also opens numerous planning opportunities for the local government.</description>

      <description>We decided to go to Cebu and spend Christmas this year with my parents and brother. I suppose it has been more than 15 years since we last celebrated Christmas together. The trip was really stressful because it was passenger season. But it was really worth lugging heavy bags since the cousins got to goof off and have a lot of fun, and the grandparents got to see all of their grandchildren in one place.</description>

      <description>Each year, on Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day, I usually surprise my darling wife with a letter/card, or a bouquet of roses. As it was a yearly thing, I knew she sort of expected these surprises; she&amp;rsquo;d look surprised, but I knew she wasn&amp;rsquo;t really. Occasionally, she does get surprised. Like that time back in Cebu when I bought her a rather intricate bouquet of flowers. Her head spun when she found out how much I paid for it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve once more moved my blog. This time, it&amp;rsquo;s on my own hosting account and it&amp;rsquo;s back to using WP. Same blog, different flavor now and moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this short discussion with a co-leader in church on going back to blogging, and he pointed out the importance of identifying to a particular niche. I said sure, it&amp;rsquo;s important, but I think I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to separate my technical gibberish from my thoughts and reflections on God and Christianity.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago, I started attending this workshop/training for leaders at Victory CDO. It&amp;rsquo;s called Training for Victory (T4V), and it was a once-a-week engagement for about 10 weeks; although it took longer than that because of several holidays around that time. We graduated and were commissioned, not as pastors, but as servants who will lead people to take on a personal relationship with Christ. By God&amp;rsquo;s grace, I was also the recipient of the Award for Excellence during the ceremonies.</description>

      <description>Miguel and Isabel goofing off in front of the laptop. They discovered the 4-shot option and started taking pictures by themselves.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t mind if I start posting more pictures here. I’ve really been keeping myself from posting these to Facebook, which was the natural tendency, no thanks to endless egging by the family. But no. It’s been a couple of years now that I’ve wanted to steer clear from FB when it comes to posting pictures; especially of family.</description>

      <description>I am home, and enjoying my second lease in life, one slow day at a time. I have never been hospitalized for something as life-threatening as DHF with complications before, so it&amp;rsquo;s a bit frustrating that even when I&amp;rsquo;m already out of the hospital, I could not move around as much as I want. I could not even attempt to lift and carry my son when he feels like asking me to hoist him up.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of new templates on Blogger now. The last time I checked in 2009, there were just the old themes that sort of grow old on you faster than gym socks.
My only gripe is that getting all of my posts imported from a Wordpress platform is rather difficult. I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to just start from a clean slate, but I have tons of notes from my old posts and I&amp;rsquo;d like to see them all from one site.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve recently decided to cover the whole area where the outdoor canteen was and turn into an activity area. I was supposed to have completed the electrical wiring last Saturday but the materials were delivered at noon and I was already quite content with just spending the afternoon with the kids.
Will post more pictures this week as we try and finish the fascia, flooring, and electrical works.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way since 2006; but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 2009 that we had a solid team based in CDO. We&amp;rsquo;re not even all sysads, but we love the fact that besides Romar, who has been my friend from way back, it was only after Carlo and Alvin joined GWF did we learn where they&amp;rsquo;re from.
Looking forward to another TBA at the later part of this year, hopefully with more people.</description>

      <description>I have again changed the look of my tech blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve actually mulled over this for quite some time since I was also thinking of just moving everything to my own hosted Wordpress install. But, lazy as I am, I was content to tweak as little as I can. Posterous has a few really nice themes built-in so moving my stuff out was really a bad idea.
In case you&amp;rsquo;re curious, here are some of the things that I intend to complete this month:</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t written a proper blog entry since 2006. I feel that my recent entries are worthy of post tags that I would consider &amp;ldquo;forgettable&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;archive-able&amp;rdquo; (if there is such a thing).
I so need motivation. Anything to get the old drive for writing flowing in my veins again. I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate any inputs from you. Just leave a comment.
At this stage, I can&amp;rsquo;t say I still want this blog focused on work and tech stuff.</description>

      <description>We went to Musuan, in Bukidnon. It&amp;rsquo;s home to the &amp;ldquo;boob&amp;rdquo; mountain, hence the name &amp;ldquo;Musuan&amp;rdquo;. Our dear Aunt Celia passed on and relatives from all over convened in CMU (where she was administrator). We spent the night in RR Family Spring Resort in Tubigon, border of Maramag, and after the wake swam in the fresh water pools, braving the intense cold. :D</description>

      <description>We love Dimsum Diner, but we gotta start learning to keep ourselves from eating there too often. Why? We&amp;rsquo;re all high risk people, that&amp;rsquo;s why.
In this set, my sister-in-law was playing around with the camera settings, which explains the no-flash feature. Will try to do another shoot next time and will play with ISO and WB. Not a DSLR. Lugging that with us during family eat-outs is overkill.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded and installed MantisBT 1.2.3stable on linode2, and after fixing permissions issues, proceeded with the installation. I stopped when I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the same MantisBT version on the old server. It&amp;rsquo;s always better to set up MantisBT on the target server &amp;ldquo;as is&amp;rdquo;, and let the install scripts handle the upgrade.
I&amp;rsquo;m roughly 28% in with a server-to-server SCP of a 79Mb MySQL dump of our bugtracker. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to check with the backups since I felt that a fresh dump is always best; but no, I remembered that several developers preferred working odd hours and they would definitely need the bug tracker up.</description>

      <description>I was looking for a quick and painless way to determine what IP addresses used our web app the most and stumbled across this excellent post. I got reminded of the power of the command-line interface and that often, I underestimate the way these commands are supposed to make a sysad&amp;rsquo;s life easier.
So here&amp;rsquo;s a quick tip for counting unique visitors to your web app. Locate your web app&amp;rsquo;s log file and do a quick scan of the last few lines.</description>

My wife and I are in distress due to lack of sleep, but we&amp;rsquo;re still hopeful. We were advised to wait until 6pm tonight to get another CBC exam. That&amp;rsquo;s because aside from her fever, she hasn&amp;rsquo;t been showing the other symptoms, e.</description>

      <description>Some of my students reported that they were having problems connecting to their repositories using TortoiseSVN. At first, quick checks from my end didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal what caused these, but I realized soon that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a server issue. It seems like the client software that they were using (TortoiseSVN) didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to make of the svn+ssh://[user]@[ip]:[port]/[repo] URL.
I use RabbitVCS on my Linux boxen and get the same &amp;ldquo;Network connection closed unexpectedly&amp;rdquo; message.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a lot of productivity tools to get better control over my ever-bloating task lists, and none have been as effective for me, as using Gmail with the GTDInbox add-on, and Google Tasks. How I make these work for me is a result of several months of trials, using Google Tasks initially, then with custom labeling and automatic label switching with GTDInbox.
The goal was simple, and that was to attain inbox zero at least once a day.</description>

So maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just delete my old LJ account and start ranting here, for real. My Posterous account would then be a photoblog of sorts, since I can post directly to it via Gravity on my phone.</description>

      <description>I love my wife. She&amp;rsquo;s all about the greater levels of thoughtfulness that I don&amp;rsquo;t have, and earlier today, she&amp;rsquo;s outdone herself once more.
In a few hours she had completed all of her Christmas shopping for my god-children and nephews and nieces. No thanks to me; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand gift shopping unless it&amp;rsquo;s for her or my kids, much worse if it&amp;rsquo;s for some other people.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;m all for giving gifts as long as it&amp;rsquo;s in the budget, but man, only my wife can think of what stuff to buy.</description>

      <guid>https://triggered.doblados.net/posts/export-tweetdeck-groups-in-ubuntu/</guid>
      <description>If you have multiple installs of TweetDeck on different computers, I bet you wished there were ways to save the groups you set up. These groupings are not saved in your Twitter profile, but are kept in a local database in your computer. This means that for each install of TweetDeck, you will have to re-set up your groups, and any changes won&amp;rsquo;t replicate to your other installs.
This post about copying TweetDeck settings in Windows explains this in detail, and I have been able to do the same for Ubuntu, replicating TweetDeck settings across 3 machines.</description>

      <description>Mae was supposed to have given birth already, but all she ever had were a few minutes of labor, and they’d disappear and won’t come back until after a few hours. The baby’s already a 7+ pounder and all he wants to do is eat more I guess. He just keeps kicking until Mae munches on something. Definitely, we don’t want him growing as big as Kysa when she came out; at 9.</description>

      <description>So I renewed my domain name earlier and thought about writing more just to balance the traffic I get for the domain, which is around 20% HTTP, and 80% SMTP.
Mail is obviously important, and since I had Gmail handle mails, everything’s been very stress free. Google just works, right? So migrating once again back to Blogger for my rant pages is now a no-brainer. Stay tuned for more.</description>

      <description>I’m already feeling the need to kick myself for taking full load this semester, but as my wife would always say, I’ve seen worse days and situations and just as long as I stuck with “the” plan, no problems.
or now, I need to answer the following questions: Am I ready for distance education? Am I ready to teach online?</description>

      <description>I was trying to remove AgileAgenda after fiddling with it for a week and deciding it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to cut it. There&amp;rsquo;s no Adobe Air Application &amp;ldquo;uninstaller&amp;rdquo; in the menu, and search engine results usually point to Mac lurv, or not. Seems like uninstalling Air apps on OSX is bloody.I did find this nice article on removing Adobe Air on Linux and gave it (well parts of it) a shot.jon@jedi-ntbk:/opt$ sudo dpkg -S /opt/*adobeair-enu: /opt/Adobe AIRcom.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this problem with Plesk since I started relying heavily on it in 2006. For some reason, after you&amp;rsquo;ve added your client, allocated IP address to client&amp;rsquo;s pool, added a domain, and selecting physical hosting, you get the message:
Unable to update hosting preferences: hosting update is failed: object ID is invalid
After getting this error, you get the domain listed, but still requiring set up. Attempting to complete physical hosting setup will give you same result.</description>

      <description>opensource gets another breakthrough today, as canonical launches launchpad personal package archive (PPA), an ubuntu linux developers service intended to extend collaboration in software development and give the community equal opportunity to build and package code for ubuntu on the desktop, server, and for mobile applications.
great news for those itching to modify packages and contribute to the furtherance of opensource! users can make changes on packages of their choice, and these will be published in the PPA system, somewhat like a special repository.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been updating for several important, albeit lousy reasons.
Work has been keeping me up at nights and i feel that if i were to write entries, i wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be making much sense.
technobabble is fun, but i&amp;rsquo;ve long outgrown this preference for writing. call it a maturing of sorts, and i&amp;rsquo;m now ready to take things (read: blogging) to higher levels.
i&amp;rsquo;ve almost completely forgotten about deepest sender, a cool firefox extension for blogging, and it&amp;rsquo;s great to be using it again</description>

      <description>i&amp;rsquo;ve had this happen to me again the other week and as always, felt like kicking myself for not remembering.
we do a lot of performance tuning on mysql, and as a result, we almost always manage to get plesk mangled. not its fault, it just can&amp;rsquo;t run without mysql, doh.
not of preference, but plesk happens to be there to make handling domains easier, as a single editing point when you want to change something and not worry about missing something out.</description>

      <description>I recently got Ubuntu Feisty Fawn Beta running on my HP Pavilion dv2001tu notebook, and I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with the way it&amp;rsquo;s running. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and have been doing the past month. Nothing out of the ordinary for me, but some of the activities mentioned here could have been keeping you up late at nights, coveting much of the understated successes ofrunning Ubuntu on HP laptops. If this is indeed so, do let me know your woes and I&amp;rsquo;ll see what I can do to help.</description>

Two of the milestones that I&amp;rsquo;ve unknowingly and unwittingly accomplished would include (in order, sorry):
PR6 (yea, before it went offline for almost a month, and before Google deployed new algorithms sometime in Feb) 20,453 spam comments since I replaced my Wordpress.</description>

      <description>Honestly, I haven&amp;rsquo;t done any coding in the last 4 months, which is really odd, because I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d be this detached from programming. But I guess there&amp;rsquo;s more to life than just developing or sustaining passion for singulars. So much for trying not to stay generalist.
So I have this personal domain now, and I&amp;rsquo;m just glad google apps isn&amp;rsquo;t as stiff with the applications anymore. The new interface totally rocks too.</description>

      <description>Almost a month of downtime. The servers were fine, but our IP addresses were not. Somehow, a system bug from one of the hosting companies caused our plan to include 14 other IP addresses, and we only maintained 6 as far as I am concerned.
So the hosting company eventually understood what was happening and started asking the right questions. The bug is that the system allowed network administrators to assign to new clients, the IP addresses that have already been assigned to a current client.</description>

      <title>Using symbolic links for MySQL data files</title>

      <guid>https://triggered.doblados.net/posts/using-symbolic-links-for-mysql-data-files/</guid>
      <description>Over a year ago, we had several servers configured for high traffic websites. A mispartioning resulted in /var becoming obscenely small, and it was only after MySQL crashed that we remembered this. We couldn’t afford more downtime if we dealt with the partition size problem, so I thought of quickly moving the data files into /home/mysql/{dbname} from /var/lib/mysql/{dbname} and create the symlink /var/lib/mysql/{dbname} -&amp;gt; /home/mysql/{dbname}.
I was not certain of the performance implications to this.</description>

      <description>I love thinking. They say thinking burns as many calories as when you&amp;rsquo;re having sex&amp;hellip;so you may liken thinking to sex. Sounds good, eh? But be warned. Although you can easily fake either one, you don&amp;rsquo;t lose as many calories as doing it for real!
This isn&amp;rsquo;t a sex column, so it&amp;rsquo;s best I get straight to the point and present my thoughts on what aggregated thinking is (and what constitutes faking it).</description>

      <description>Casey Kasem’s American Top 40 broadcast back in April 1988 is being streamed today over XM Radio. Def Leppard’s Hysteria is currently playing. Measures and measures of this classic hit flood my ears and I can’t help but smile. There must have been thousands of Firehouse, Def Leppard, and Nelson (to name a few) playbacks since I got them cassette tapes.
I still think that the 1980’s was the best decade to grow in.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a pretty slick Windows application that will allow you to post directly to your Blogger Beta account. The Firefox extension Deepest Sender, which allows posting to LJ, Blogger, and Wordpress, doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with Blogger Beta yet, so here&amp;rsquo;s a workaround that you can do meantime.
I prefer FOSS applications that run natively on GNU/Linux, but sometimes, you really need to use a platform where you are most productive. Writing stuff from anywhere will mean doing this from my Windows-run notebook.</description>

I headed back to CDO for Halloween vacation and was able to drop by the office to pick up some of my personal stuff. They&amp;rsquo;ve slapped in a Cisco router (where the yellow fibre cable hooks up to) and another L3 switch. The old firewall appliance is still there, reliable as ever. Cabling got more structured as well.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m currently catching up on readings for my thesis pre-proposal. Some projects are quite interesting, notably those that do geographic encoding, location tracing via IP, or widget development, using Google Maps technology.</description>

Quick googling led me to Frank Spychalski&amp;rsquo;s very good article, which covers the essentials of configuring Google Talk on Kopete. For Ubuntu users, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have Kopete yet, you will need an internet connection to get the necessary packages.</description>

By the end of the month, I will be moving to the Queen City of the South, with my family in tow. I’m just glad that those guys at the new company were willing to wait for me. I was sure they understood the situation; I have established base in CDO and am currently employed. I was the one who was getting uprooted, so it was just proper that they agreed to waiting.</description>

      <description>Over the Holy Week, two of our home computer&amp;rsquo;s drives crashed, probably due to extensive user download, software installs, and malware. I had to do work on the laptop for a while, and since everyone in the house was itching for Internet access, I brought in a small IDE drive (roughly around 9Gb) that was mounted as slave on my office computer and popped that in the home computer. I had more than enough reasons to put Ubuntu back in there, and nobody would be complaining!</description>

      <description>I had the opportunity to spend a few days vacationing in Manila. My mom-in-law was attending a national conference for pediatricians, and was given travel sponsorships for the entire family. I jumped at the chance to visit my aging Lola because she had not seen her great granddaughter, as the case was with all of my QC-based relatives. Our itinerary was real tight, but I was happy anyway since we went through so many unexpected, yet pleasant surprises en route to Manila until we got back here.</description>

      <description>Met up with hardwyard last night for preliminary competition planning. Also present were some of the pillars of GNU/Linux and FOSS in Northern Mindanao: Mr. Rem Taga of MPSC, Mr. Botp Peña of DMPC, and Mr. Vidor Balbon of Philcom.
I hope to keep up with these guys considering that my GNU/Linux experience is so diversified and I&amp;rsquo;d have to polish skills on specific services, some of which I&amp;rsquo;ve not even bothered tinkering with.</description>

      <guid>https://triggered.doblados.net/posts/disabling-ntpupdate/</guid>
      <description>This has been quite overdue, as I have been wanting to disable ntpupdate since the Hoary release. What is ntpupdate anyway? It&amp;rsquo;s the program that synchronizes your system time to an ntp server. Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol for synchronising the clocks of computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.
Since Ubuntu defaults to an ntp server somewhere in the www, and that it will attempt to sync on boot, it causes your machine to go through a much much longer startup process if an internet connection is not available at boot time.</description>

A highschool buddy paid us a visit today and she too told me to get a Friendster account and you know, start catching up as well (she&amp;rsquo;d rather that I find out about my batch&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts by myself than get bugged by me). So if you&amp;rsquo;re a buddy of mine, add me to your 300+ node network of friends, jon dot doblados at gmail dot com.</description>

      <description>The coming finals in my e-commerce class got me browsing through piles of readings and notes and I realized that I have not fully appreciated e-commerce as I should have. A techie will know what digital signatures, catalogs, EDI&amp;rsquo;s, EFT&amp;rsquo;s, shopping carts, or SSL are, as applied to buying and selling online; but graduate school won&amp;rsquo;t even let you wallow in those.
Instead, one gets tasked to relate e-commerce with business processes, and usually, look for solutions to support business processes that e-commerce systems can&amp;rsquo;t support.</description>

Pardon me, I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d be quoting myself this early. =). I just feel like I got to explain myself. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on LJ since 2000. There&amp;rsquo;s a high level of pride associated with web logging that early, and I know most of us have been around and can relate to this feeling.</description>

      <description>I had a good consultation session with my mentor last Saturday and I got great advise for my thesis. I&amp;rsquo;m planting my foot on GIS and applications, but the whole gamut of GIS is fairly large so I had to zero in on what I really wanted to focus on. Future research prospects on GIS led me to look up Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to as GRASS. It&amp;rsquo;s so cool because for starters, it&amp;rsquo;s GPLed, and it will run on PostgreSQL.</description>

      <description>I am one with the millions of CSI fans raring to watch the 2-hour season finale of the top rated series on television. Quentin Tarantino has been tapped to direct this one and I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;ll be a very, very good 2 hours. My daughter needs to sleep a good hour before that starts because she won&amp;rsquo;t sleep if she sees CSI on. Like father, like daughter.
I posted this on my tech blog, but I feel that I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have more people see it here in LJ, which will hopefully translate to more ready answers for me.</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to install the darn thing. So I dl&amp;rsquo;ed mysql-standard-4.1.12-unknown-linux-gnu-powerpc-glibc23.tar.gz and tried to use the binaries instead.Viola! MySQL4.1.12 managed to run fine.</description>

      <description>I got really dissed last night waiting for instructors to report for class. It almost seemed prank-like to me, because we were all waiting for this guy to show up, and just a few minutes before we were afforded a free cut, somebody got SMS from the instructor, apologizing that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to make it (again). It probably came late because of network lag, but I&amp;rsquo;d glady discount that because it was a 3-hr class and we waited for almost an hour for the cut.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back at work. My recent sickness made me think again about my eating habits, my vices, and how I love shunning medication and prescriptions; preferring proper rest and vigorous exercise over anything pharmaceutically made. It was a community-acquired viral infection that made the insides of my lungs all pulpy and lugaw-like. I was short of getting the P200+ kind of antibiotic. It was a good thing I was responding well to what I was taking in.</description>

After all, I have started web logging in LJ, so there&amp;rsquo;s /dev/null chance that I&amp;rsquo;ll favor another over this one.I&amp;rsquo;m giving myself a few more weeks to play around with it. I&amp;rsquo;m just happy that I have a server that I can commandeer at any time.</description>

      <description>What a month it has been! It was my first time to do facilitating work relevant to equipment acquisition, and everything has been so cooperative (thank God!). The only thing that&amp;rsquo;s keeping me from getting giddy with anticipation over the delivery of those servers is the fact that the PO hasn&amp;rsquo;t been issued yet. It seems to me that Purchasing people have this degree of power over everyone else, in the sense that they can always mull over our longing to have stuff bought right away and decide to do delaying tactics just for the hell of it.</description>
