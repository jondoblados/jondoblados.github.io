                        <p>I love thinking. They say thinking burns as many calories as when you're having sex...so you may liken thinking to sex. Sounds good, eh? But be warned.&nbsp;Although you can easily&nbsp;fake either one, you don't lose as many calories as doing it for real!</p> <p>This isn't a sex column, so it's best I get&nbsp;straight to the point and present my thoughts on what&nbsp;aggregated thinking is (and&nbsp;what constitutes faking&nbsp;it). Wiktionary defines <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aggregate">aggregation</a> as an act of bringing together, or collecting into a mass or sum.</p> <p>We programmers are more familiar with aggregation as a slight modification of composition (yeah, we're no fun). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition#Aggregation">Aggregation</a> differs from ordinary composition in that it does not imply ownership. For example, an older model of a car engine will have a carburetor (yeah, it's spelled that way). Take away the engine and the carburetor will lose its usability. That's composition.&nbsp;Then there's a pond with a duck swimming about. Take&nbsp;away the pond and the duck will still be a waddling&nbsp;duck, and will continue to exist as one. That's aggregation.</p> <p>When used to modify the verb thinking,&nbsp;aggregation may&nbsp;denote:</p> <ol> <li>thinking as a process of collecting or&nbsp;bringing together facts, ideas, and other thoughts and try to make sense out of their fusion,</li> <li>thinking in order to benefit not&nbsp;only yourself but everyone&nbsp;who&nbsp;is in your thought stream as well,</li> <li>thinking&nbsp;in a radical way, such as&nbsp;being "one" with what is generally accepted&nbsp;but in a manner that retains one's identity and ownership over thoughts</li></ol> <p>Clearly, aggregated thinking is awesome brain calisthenics. So aggregate your thinking when you can. God did not create mindless people to go where&nbsp; mindful" people go. If you lost your backbone,&nbsp;get one ASAP, and start thinking for real.</p> <p>To fake all these,&nbsp;you can cheat! You can take public opinion and adopt that as&nbsp;your own.&nbsp;You can also&nbsp;squint&nbsp;your eyes and frown like&nbsp;you're in deep thought, trying&nbsp;to look busy! Whichever way,&nbsp;you don't&nbsp;burn calories, and&nbsp;you don't&nbsp;burn off any brain cells. :)</p>
