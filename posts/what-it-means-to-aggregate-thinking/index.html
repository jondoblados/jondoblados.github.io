  <h1>What it means to aggregate thinking</h1>
  <p>I love thinking. They say thinking burns as many calories as when you&rsquo;re having sex&hellip;so you may liken thinking to sex. Sounds good, eh? But be warned. Although you can easily fake either one, you don&rsquo;t lose as many calories as doing it for real!</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a sex column, so it&rsquo;s best I get straight to the point and present my thoughts on what aggregated thinking is (and what constitutes faking it). Wiktionary defines <!-- raw HTML omitted -->aggregation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as an act of bringing together, or collecting into a mass or sum.</p>
<p>We programmers are more familiar with aggregation as a slight modification of composition (yeah, we&rsquo;re no fun). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aggregation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> differs from ordinary composition in that it does not imply ownership. For example, an older model of a car engine will have a carburetor (yeah, it&rsquo;s spelled that way). Take away the engine and the carburetor will lose its usability. That&rsquo;s composition. Then there&rsquo;s a pond with a duck swimming about. Take away the pond and the duck will still be a waddling duck, and will continue to exist as one. That&rsquo;s aggregation.</p>
<p>When used to modify the verb thinking, aggregation may denote:</p>
<ul>
<li>thinking as a process of collecting or bringing together facts, ideas, and other thoughts and try to make sense out of their fusion,</li>
<li>thinking in order to benefit not only yourself but everyone who is in your thought stream as well,</li>
<li>thinking in a radical way, such as being &ldquo;one&rdquo; with what is generally accepted but in a manner that retains one&rsquo;s identity and ownership over thoughts</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, aggregated thinking is awesome brain calisthenics. So aggregate your thinking when you can. God did not create mindless people to go where  mindful&quot; people go. If you lost your backbone, get one ASAP, and start thinking for real.</p>
<p>To fake all these, you can cheat! You can take public opinion and adopt that as your own. You can also squint your eyes and frown like you&rsquo;re in deep thought, trying to look busy! Whichever way, you don&rsquo;t burn calories, and you don&rsquo;t burn off any brain cells. :)</p>
