<p>These are some of the pictures I took during the CDO (Cagayan de Oro) and Cebu legs of our 2019 trip to the Philippines. In CDO, we did a joint birthday celebration for our kids since their birthdays are just a week apart. It was a great time to catch up with extended family and friends.</p>

<p>We then flew to Cebu City and spent a couple of days meeting family and close friends. Since Cebu has direct flights to Singapore, it made a lot of sense to make the Queen City of the South as the last stop.</p>
