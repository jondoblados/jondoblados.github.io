  <p>Going cold turkey for good. We had deliverance last weekend and I was pretty sure then that it was time to quit. I’m a few months short of making it to 15 years of puffing away, but hell I’m not going to wait for that anymore. I’m on my 4th no-smoke day, and I think I’m going to make it. Withdrawal symptoms were raging hard yesterday and I had to take the rest of the afternoon off. Felt like hurling most of the time and I was getting those “vertigo” dots flashing/drifting wherever I look.</p>
<p>On top of it all, I’m still on drugs, getting prepped for tooth extraction. Tsk.</p>
