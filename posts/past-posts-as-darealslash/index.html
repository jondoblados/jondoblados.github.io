                        <p>Yaaaaaaah!!! I burned myself with my own cig butt!  Sheesh.  Don&rsquo;t underestimate the butt.  Surely, it&rsquo;ll want to get back at u after u&rsquo;ve used it, (kaw kaya sipsipin at paglaruan dyan!) even more if u don&rsquo;t thank it for at least serving its purpose!<p />My wife&rsquo;s giving birth anyday now and I&rsquo;m just sooooo excited!  Huh? Am I ready u mean? To be a father yes but frankly, we don&rsquo;t have everything ready for the baby; y&rsquo;know, the post natal stuff u need to have. Tsk! Tag-hirap chong!<p />Who says u have to be a politician or an actor so u could stay in the delivery room too? Dammit! If that were true then where&rsquo;s the fun? Sorry muh dearest wife, I know it aint fun pushing and laboring, but hey&hellip; those movies of husbands sticking with their wifes show a kind of elation that I wanna feel first-hand! Screw the rules! :P<p />What&rsquo;s the strongest anti-migraine, over the counter drug u know? I got a bout yesterday and got bedridden almost the whole day. It&rsquo;s still trying to creep back as I type this; nothing seems to work anymore!<p />I tried some drug here in the office (which my boss gave to one co-employee) and it worked a bit. Must be a downer. ?!*@&amp;^<p />I lost my lighter again!<br/><br/><b>current mood:</b> <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><br/><img alt="Media_httpstatlivejou_aaqlg" height="40" src="http://jon.doblados.net/wp-content/uploads/2003/09/media_httpstatlivejou_aaqlg.gif" width="40" /><br/></div><br/> bouncy<br/><b>current music:</b> December - Collective Soul<br/><br/><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/darealslash/916.html">1 comment</a><br/><hr /><br/><b>Monday, March 5th, 2001</b><br/><br/>I saw the accident over at Guadalupe between two airconditioned buses yesterday.  I&rsquo;ve never seen so much shattered, more like powdered, automotive glass on the street.  Twisted metal, the rescue squad (btw, I think they&rsquo;re a little too OA; like they&rsquo;re so much into their roles that they almost look like they&rsquo;re in some action flick&hellip;well, ok, it&rsquo;s their ballpark but hey, I&rsquo;d have that FEEL of authority anytime!), and I think I saw blood but I was too uuhhh&hellip;giddy, yeah sumthin like that, to even take a closer look.<p />It felt weird; I&rsquo;m not exactly thrilled about the idea of gory things, much more see blood in places other than the wet market, but you know it&rsquo;s not supposed to be there!<p />I would&rsquo;ve taken the bus to Nova.  There&rsquo;s one route that&rsquo;ll drop me right outside our village but decided not to.  My innards were still churning so I rode the MRT instead.<p />Next time you decide to patronize public transport, check out the driver!  That driver who went splat against the MRT wall looked sabog daw and decided to scare the other bus by flicking its tail.  Careened out of control and went for the swatter! Perfect 10!<p />And don&rsquo;t ride the buses when it&rsquo;s so late at night or so early in the morning!  You won&rsquo;t get to choose which bus to ride anymore and at those hours, EDSA turns into a racetrack!<p />I know, tarantado rin akong magdrive but one good look at how graphic the last scene is is now making me hesitate a lot before I can even step hard on the gas.<br/><br/><b>current mood:</b> <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><br/><img alt="Media_httpstatlivejou_vhjkd" height="40" src="http://jon.doblados.net/wp-content/uploads/2003/09/media_httpstatlivejou_vHjkd.gif" width="40" /><br/></div><br/> drunk<br/><b>current music:</b> Blitzkrieg - Metallica<br/><br/><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/darealslash/516.html">3 comments</a><br/><hr /><br/><b>Wednesday, February 28th, 2001 11:51 pm</b><br/><b>First dip, I may have found my non-reactive sounding board</b><br/><br/>Hey Kai! Thanks a lot for leading me here. I could have used this a loooonnggg time ago!<p />Cooling my heels in the office (yeah, I KNOW walang OT d2 but dammit!); can&rsquo;t go home and stare at the ceiling.  I&rsquo;d probably just get da urge to txt her.  Don&rsquo;t want to anymore, not for a week I guess.  I txtd 2K messages in one billing period! Felt like kicking myself.<p />So I went through this whole you-look-glum-what&rsquo;s-wrong? routine and nobody seemed to notice here.  Hah! Probably because they never see me wearing some other face!<br/><br/><b>current mood:</b> <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><br/><img alt="Media_httpstatlivejou_qazmf" height="40" src="http://jon.doblados.net/wp-content/uploads/2003/09/media_httpstatlivejou_qazmF.gif" width="40" /><br/></div><br/> cranky<br/><b>current music:</b> Let It Be Me<br/><br/><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/darealslash/463.html">6 comments</a></p>
