                        <p>Each year, on Valentine&rsquo;s day, I usually surprise my darling wife with a letter/card, or a bouquet of roses. As it was a yearly thing, I knew she sort of expected these surprises; she&rsquo;d look surprised, but I knew she wasn&rsquo;t really. Occasionally, she does get surprised. Like that time back in Cebu when I bought her a rather intricate bouquet of flowers. Her head spun when she found out how much I paid for it. Surprise!<br/><br/><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"><a href="http://jon.doblados.net/2013/02/valentine-surprise/2013-02-13-21-54-18/" rel="attachment wp-att-3323"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3323" alt="2013-02-13 21.54.18" src="http://jon.doblados.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-13-21.54.18-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>This year, however, is different. I was not able to prepare anything for her. I didn&rsquo;t get her anything, thinking that I&rsquo;d just make up for it with dinner, or something. Yes, I didn&rsquo;t plan for this and I feel lousy actually. Last night, after my daughter gave me and my wife her home-made Valentine greeting cards, my wife started chiding me about what I was going to give her the next day. I gave her my usual &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling&rdquo; smile and silently kicked myself. I wished I already had something ready, and I found myself already longing for the anticipation of the surprise&rsquo;s revelation.</span><br/><br/><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Obviously, I&rsquo;ve already fallen off the bus-called-state-of-preparedness, and my chances of springing a surprise is not looking good. But during this morning&rsquo;s rush, my wife told me to look at my backpack and I got a shock. Sticking out of the front pocket was what clearly looked like greeting card. I pulled out the card from its envelope, opened it, read what she wrote on it, looked at her, and saw her give me that knowing smile. It was her turn to surprise me.</span><br/><br/><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"><a href="http://jon.doblados.net/2013/02/valentine-surprise/2013-02-13-21-53-51/" rel="attachment wp-att-3324"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-3324" alt="2013-02-13 21.53.51" src="http://jon.doblados.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-13-21.53.51-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>I thank God for this experience. It reminds me that no matter the circumstance, all things turn for good. Far from being a perfect relationship, it is by faith that we&rsquo;ve persisted in believing in God&rsquo;s plans and promises for us. And ultimately, it is by His grace that we were given this great relationship to enjoy. I was too concerned with the fact that I did not have anything prepared for this day. God reminds me that more than surprises, and more than how the world celebrates Valentine&rsquo;s day, it is the relationships that He affords and blesses me that I must nurture and be thankful for. <em>&ldquo;The Lord is righteous in all his ways and faithful in all he does&rdquo; (Psalm 145:17).</em></span><br/><br/><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">How awesome it is to have Him who is all-faithful to back you up! </span></p>
