  <h1>Hysteria</h1>
  <p>Casey Kasem’s American Top 40 broadcast back in April 1988 is being streamed today over XM Radio. Def Leppard’s Hysteria is currently playing. Measures and measures of this classic hit flood my ears and I can’t help but smile. There must have been thousands of Firehouse, Def Leppard, and Nelson (to name a few) playbacks since I got them cassette tapes.</p>
<p>I still think that the 1980’s was the best decade to grow in. All those crazy get-ups that now look fugly, the hair, and man, the dance moves! I did all those, and proudly at that. You wouldn’t blame me though, because like anyone who’s an 80’s kid, I’m peculiar. :)</p>
