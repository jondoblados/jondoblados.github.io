  <h1>End-of-the-month TODOs</h1>
  <p>I have again changed the look of my tech blog. I&rsquo;ve actually mulled over this for quite some time since I was also thinking of just moving everything to my own hosted Wordpress install. But, lazy as I am, I was content to tweak as little as I can. Posterous has a few really nice themes built-in so moving my stuff out was really a bad idea.</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re curious, here are some of the things that I intend to complete this month:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finish half of my self-imposed OpenStack Compute reading assignment. Oh wait, that wouldn&rsquo;t be half, since I intend to test run an OpenStack Compute instance. :p</li>
<li>With my buddy Romar, complete and deploy a hosting infrastructure over AWS, using of all things, Pound as a proxy, with lots of small and micro EC2 instances serving data from a single, extra large and high-memory RDS instance.</li>
<li>Upgrade the main EC2 instance where Pound lives so it can take a beating. I will most likely do some tests with the actual traffic in order to determine if Pound is memory or CPU extensive; and this will help me decide which type of instance to upgrade to later on.</li>
<li>Upload one of my audio rants as a podcast. My being slightly OC doesn&rsquo;t help at all, really. I got half a mind wanting to redo them.</li>
<li>Complete a custom theme for my wife&rsquo;s food blog. Yeah, I owe her big time. Maybe I ought to bump this up to #1.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do stuff like I do, I&rsquo;d be glad to hear from you.</p>
