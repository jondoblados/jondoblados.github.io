                    </h2>

                    <p>Almost a month of downtime. The servers were fine, but our IP addresses
were not. Somehow, a system bug from one of the hosting companies caused
our plan to include 14 other IP addresses, and we only maintained 6 as
far as I am concerned.</p>
<p>So the hosting company eventually understood what was happening and
started asking the right questions. The bug is that the system allowed
network administrators to assign to new clients, the IP addresses that
have already been assigned to a current client.</p>
<p>We spent crazy hours figuring out what happened. Since the domains were
not loading our sites, and instead were redirecting to some domains we
don’t own (real bad sites btw), we checked if .htaccess was modified and
tested if it was working at all. I also did double checks on virtual
host configurations and they all looked clean.</p>
<p>I started thinking that it was a routing issue. We were not using the
publicly routable IPs for the virtual hosts; instead, we used internal
IPs as mapped to the firewall hardware. A lookup on the domain/s that we
were being redirected to reported different IP addresses, which didn’t
readily confirm my suspicions, but stressed the possibility of
IP-hijacking.</p>
<p>It’s not supposed to be taken in the context of BGP (border gateway
protocol), as this is beyond me. Instead, think of your assumption over
IP addresses that we’re using, to serve your websites. Sounds clear? I
hope it does. I got pretty lost myself and it isn’t after deep digging
at the hosting company’s end that their errors became apparent.</p>
<p>So in the light of this realization, I’ve already moved the domains to
some other hosting. Way too much work and way uncool.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Over a year ago, we had several servers configured for high traffic
websites. A mispartioning resulted in /var becoming obscenely small, and
it was only after MySQL crashed that we remembered this. We couldn’t
afford more downtime if we dealt with the partition size problem, so I
thought of quickly moving the data files into /home/mysql/{dbname} from
/var/lib/mysql/{dbname} and create the symlink /var/lib/mysql/{dbname}
-> /home/mysql/{dbname}.</p>
<p>I was not certain of the performance implications to this. I heard from
a fellow Linux junkie here that there may be a slight penalties in terms
of access speed, since /home was meant for generic read/write, whereas
/var was accessed in a very quick manner. Gotta verify this. But for
now, I dwell in the power of symbolic links.</p>

                    <p>Sure, my bosses do this all the time…in airports, hotel lobbies, and
coffee shops. The mere act of “connecting” to an unsecured wireless
network doubles as a necessity and as a leaching of sorts. Gotta love
wireless. :)</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>I love thinking. They say thinking burns as many calories as when you're
having sex...so you may liken thinking to sex. Sounds good, eh? But be
warned. Although you can easily fake either one, you don't lose as many
calories as doing it for real!</p>
<p>This isn't a sex column, so it's best I get straight to the point and
present my thoughts on what aggregated thinking is (and what constitutes
faking it). Wiktionary defines
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aggregate">aggregation</a> as an act of
bringing together, or collecting into a mass or sum.</p>
<p>We programmers are more familiar with aggregation as a slight
modification of composition (yeah, we're no fun).
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition#Aggregation">Aggregation</a>
differs from ordinary composition in that it does not imply ownership.
For example, an older model of a car engine will have a carburetor
(yeah, it's spelled that way). Take away the engine and the carburetor
will lose its usability. That's composition. Then there's a pond with a
duck swimming about. Take away the pond and the duck will still be a
waddling duck, and will continue to exist as one. That's aggregation.</p>
<p>When used to modify the verb thinking, aggregation may denote:</p>
<ol>
<li>thinking as a process of collecting or bringing together facts,
    ideas, and other thoughts and try to make sense out of their fusion,</li>
<li>thinking in order to benefit not only yourself but everyone who is
    in your thought stream as well,</li>
<li>thinking in a radical way, such as being "one" with what is
    generally accepted but in a manner that retains one's identity and
    ownership over thoughts</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, aggregated thinking is awesome brain calisthenics. So aggregate
your thinking when you can. God did not create mindless people to go
where  mindful" people go. If you lost your backbone, get one ASAP, and
start thinking for real.</p>
<p>To fake all these, you can cheat! You can take public opinion and adopt
that as your own. You can also squint your eyes and frown like you're in
deep thought, trying to look busy! Whichever way, you don't burn
calories, and you don't burn off any brain cells. :)</p>
