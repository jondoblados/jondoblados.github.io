    <p>What a month it has been! It was my first time to do facilitating work
relevant to equipment acquisition, and everything has been so
cooperative (thank God!). The only thing that's keeping me from getting
giddy with anticipation over the delivery of those servers is the fact
that the PO hasn't been issued yet. It seems to me that Purchasing
people have this degree of power over everyone else, in the sense that
they can always mull over our longing to have stuff bought right away
and decide to do delaying tactics just for the hell of it.  </p>
<p>I wished we had arrived earlier for the second day round of technical
sessions of the 1st ICT summit held here. Flight delays brought about by
the big typhoon caused major shifting of schedules and I'm pretty sure a
lot of people missed the sessions they signed up for, except maybe for
those ICT die-hards who spent three whole days there and attended all
the tracks they could. <a href="http://villageidiotsavant.blogspot.com/">Dominique
Cimafranca</a> of IBM was to talk
about Data Management Storage Solutions and we missed his session! It
would have been nice if we got him to address some of our concerns, yada
yada yada.  </p>
<p>Hope IBM delivers before the year ends. :)</p>
