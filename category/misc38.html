                    </h2>

                    <p>Casey Kasem’s American Top 40 broadcast back in April 1988 is being
streamed today over XM Radio. Def Leppard’s Hysteria is currently
playing. Measures and measures of this classic hit flood my ears and I
can’t help but smile. There must have been thousands of Icehouse, Def
Leppard, and Nelson (to name a few) playbacks since I got them cassette
and 8-track tapes.</p>
<p>I still think that the 1980’s was the best decade to grow in. All those
crazy get-ups that now look fugly, the hair, and man, the dance moves! I
did all those, and proudly at that. You wouldn’t blame me though,
because like anyone who’s an 80’s kid, I’m peculiar. :)</p>

                    <p>There's a pretty slick Windows application that will allow you to post
directly to your Blogger Beta account. The Firefox extension <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1811/">Deepest
Sender</a>, which allows posting
to LJ, Blogger, and Wordpress, doesn't work with Blogger Beta yet, so
here's a
<a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!757.entry">workaround</a>
that you can do meantime.</p>
<p>I prefer FOSS applications that run natively on GNU/Linux, but
sometimes, you really need to use a platform where you are most
productive. Writing stuff from anywhere will mean doing this from
my Windows-run notebook. Not so much an issue, I hope.</p>

I wrote a memo the other day and could not help but emphasize on the
importance of using good ol' wit and common sense, when on the internet.
I probably had the gall to write these since I'm recklessly doing stuff
on Ubuntu and couldn't care less if an intrusion breaks something. LOL.
Windoze is like walking on glass. Some of the guidelines I wrote:
