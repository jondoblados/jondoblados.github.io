                    <p>I sometimes wish it were me. But I’d rather have my daughter bask in her
moment. It’s just that I clearly remember the feeling. You’re all bubbly
and excited, and you can’t stop talking about it. My daughter’s
graduating from preschool tomorrow, and my wife and I are as much into
the rush as she is.</p>
<p>1st grade, here we come. *groan*</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Honestly, I haven't done any coding in the last 4 months, which is
really odd, because I never thought I'd be this detached from
programming. But I guess there's more to life than just developing or
sustaining passion for singulars. So much for trying not to stay
generalist.</p>
<p>So I have this personal domain now, and I'm just glad google apps isn't
as stiff with the applications anymore. The new interface totally rocks
too. I just need to host the domain somewhere, for sites and blogs and
stuff.</p>
<p>If you're family, and you have a blogger account, I can get you your
custom domain working. The default blogspot.com publishing URL
will redirect to your custom domain, so I guess you won't be losing any
visitors.</p>
<p>I'm not that sure about this, but I feel that there will be noticeable
changes in how your blog fares with SE's. Some SEO stuff that I've
picked up tell me you can't have same content in multiple sites, similar
to double-posting. Seems like you can get penalized for that. Question
is, will the application of this redirecting exercise on blog a (that
has already been indexed) be seen as same content with blog b (which is
where blog a will redirect to, if and only if you decide on a custom
domain), from a search engine's view?</p>
<p>Anyway, I need a host. :) Ironically, I handle dozens of hosts; but I
can't get anywhere close to those (all dedicated servers..boohoohoo)
without first coughing up lots of cash. Yea I suppose I could just code
for it.</p>

<p>Forget the housemates! Mariel Rodriguez makes this reality TV show
"watchable". Half past midnight since the new season launched and the
server is already borked! Good thing I got to grab this pic of Mariel
before it went down (it seems to be failing intermittently...but what
can you expect from an M\$ OS anyway?)</p>
<p>Here's the error I see:  </p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>Almost a month of downtime. The servers were fine, but our IP addresses
were not. Somehow, a system bug from one of the hosting companies caused
our plan to include 14 other IP addresses, and we only maintained 6 as
far as I am concerned.</p>
<p>So the hosting company eventually understood what was happening and
started asking the right questions. The bug is that the system allowed
network administrators to assign to new clients, the IP addresses that
have already been assigned to a current client.</p>
<p>We spent crazy hours figuring out what happened. Since the domains were
not loading our sites, and instead were redirecting to some domains we
don’t own (real bad sites btw), we checked if .htaccess was modified and
tested if it was working at all. I also did double checks on virtual
host configurations and they all looked clean.</p>
<p>I started thinking that it was a routing issue. We were not using the
publicly routable IPs for the virtual hosts; instead, we used internal
IPs as mapped to the firewall hardware. A lookup on the domain/s that we
were being redirected to reported different IP addresses, which didn’t
readily confirm my suspicions, but stressed the possibility of
IP-hijacking.</p>
<p>It’s not supposed to be taken in the context of BGP (border gateway
protocol), as this is beyond me. Instead, think of your assumption over
IP addresses that we’re using, to serve your websites. Sounds clear? I
hope it does. I got pretty lost myself and it isn’t after deep digging
at the hosting company’s end that their errors became apparent.</p>
<p>So in the light of this realization, I’ve already moved the domains to
some other hosting. Way too much work and way uncool.</p>
