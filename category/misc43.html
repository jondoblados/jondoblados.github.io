                    <p>If anyone's interested, we're selling a Nokia 3200. It has great
features for an entry imaging-recording level gadget, plus more. I
especially like the cover template cutter. Check it out from Nokia:  </p>

                    <p><em>If I pointed you to another blog of mine, would you visit that as much,
considering that it would have mostly techno babble in it, and that it
won't have the indispensable "my friends" link (because it's not on
LJ)?</em>  </p>
<p>Pardon me, I never thought I'd be quoting myself this early. =). I just
feel like I got to explain myself. I've been on LJ since 2000. There's a
high level of pride associated with web logging that early, and I know
most of us have been around and can relate to this feeling. But given
that after a few years, you get your own server to use and become
productive with, I doubt if you will be able to resist favoring the
higher level of customization afforded to you. Now I won't start
comparing web logging tools and facilities because I can't. LJ is using
established methods and protocols and have carved a niche in the
blogosphere. In fact, I personally think LJ should be getting royalties
just by being around when web logging was still at its infancy. The rest
are, let's just say, "learning" from the LJ experience.  </p>
<p>My concern is not technical or feature-relevant. It's more of an
emotional strain, something akin to the feeling of having to part with
something of sentimental value. I'm having difficulty keeping up with my
updating responsibilities in LJ. Since maintaining our servers here are
part of daily work, I find it easier to blog on my server, especially
that I use emacs plannerMode. Eventually, I feel bad because I am able
to diligently update my planner and my tech blog, but not my LJ. I feel
like I've abandoned my LJ for the umpteenth time. I try and put in some
updates there, but you know, that thing that got me started on LJ years
ago, isn't there anymore. I find it hard to collect thoughts and put
them down on a worthy LJ post.  </p>
<p>My only worry is that if I decide to become a more efficient (tech)
blogger, I would have to wean myself from LJ, but not from my friends of
course. I don't have that many people on my friends list, but that's
hardly a concern. If I may say this, I am quite certain that those who
are in my friends list are very priceless treasure chests - overflowing
with intellect, maturity, and experience, all of which I will not get
anywhere else in this lifetime. I'm just hoping that even if I do move
on, they will still be around. =)  </p>
<p>But again, I'm just wondering, ergo the quoted question that opened this
entry. Nothing is definite as of yet, and I may decide to keep (read:
maintain) both after all. Oh well. The next time I start thinking aloud,
<strong>batukan nyo nga ako please</strong>. Thanks.</p>

                    <p>I had a good consultation session with my mentor last Saturday and I got
great advise for my thesis. I'm planting my foot on GIS and
applications, but the whole gamut of GIS is fairly large so I had to
zero in on what I really wanted to focus on. Future research prospects
on GIS led me to look up Geographic Resources Analysis Support System,
commonly referred to as <a href="http://geni.ath.cx/grass.html">GRASS</a>. It's so
cool because for starters, it's GPLed, and it will run on PostgreSQL.
It's primarily designed for Linux so I need to have
<a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> run on the host that I will be using to
interface with our Linux and non-Linux backends.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, my thesis will be concentrating on GIS and data warehouse
integration. Should there be an existing or current data warehouse for
me to work on, I should be able to model the integration, using the
appropriate schema. Should there be no data warehouse, I will have to
model from scratch and present and enforce the design.</p>
