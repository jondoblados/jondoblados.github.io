                    <p>
I am one with the millions of CSI fans raring to watch the 2-hour season
finale of the top rated series on television. Quentin Tarantino has been
tapped to direct this one and I'm sure it'll be a very, very good 2
hours. My daughter needs to sleep a good hour before that starts because
she won't sleep if she sees CSI on. Like father, like daughter.

I posted this on my [tech blog](http://trigger.cdo.linux.org.ph/), but I
feel that I'll probably have more people see it here in LJ, which will
hopefully translate to more ready answers for me. I did a script that
displays my planner's buffer files. It would've been easier if I used
emac's wiki publishing, but I wanted to format the output so that it'll
look good on wp, and decided on it otherwise. Save for some quirks on
the display, my tasks list shows up just fine.  

I was asking around earlier about system-dependent directory reading
methods. I couldn't get my display to sort properly. So what exactly is
the order in which directory items are fetched? In the php manual:  


>   
> Note:   
> The order in which directory entries are returned by the read method
> is system-dependent.
> </p>

<p>

I would assume that a system read from a directory will return an
alphanumerically sorted list, but I had the feeling that it isn't the
case here. I used the `dir` class (readily available in php3 and up).  


> A pseudo-object oriented mechanism for reading a directory. The given
> directory is opened. Two properties are available once the directory
> has been opened. The handle property can be used with other directory
> functions such as readdir(), rewinddir() and closedir(). The path
> property is set to path the directory that was opened. Three methods
> are available: read, rewind and close.
> </p>

<p>No parameters passed to any of these three methods. Sucks.</p>

                    <p>In my quest to have my "dead" blog resuscitated on our new p5 server so
that I have something to use for my tech notes here at work as well as
my MS requirements, I downloaded <code>MySQL-4.1.12-0.sles9.src.rpm</code> from
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">mysql.com</a> in the hope of getting
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> running on our server. I can't seem
to install the darn thing. So I dl'ed
<code>mysql-standard-4.1.12-unknown-linux-gnu-powerpc-glibc23.tar.gz</code> and
tried to use the binaries instead.  </p>
<p>Viola! MySQL4.1.12 managed to run fine. The only problem is that even
with all the usual accounts set up, including privileges and access
rights to hosts set up correctly, wordpress can't connect to the
localhost database. Baaaaad!!! I ended up setting up the database on my
trusty workstation and connected to that instead.  </p>

                    <p>Apparently, I'm still too busy to update my journal with anything other
than tech or work related stuff. So what gives? I'm still trying to get
our new vClass firewall configured right. Nothing makes sense anymore,
so I'm asking for tech support from the manufacturer. The supplier here
doesn't know shit about what they're selling. I'm starting to dread the
day when I have to tell the boss "I said this before; we should have
gone BSD for our firewalling requirements!" Yak-yak. Don't you just luv
finger-pointing?  </p>
<p>Well enough of that. I was supposed to start posting course work for my
masterals last week. I have over 6 articles/commentaries to do.
*groan* Better start working.</p>
