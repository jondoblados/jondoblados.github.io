The last time I checked in 2009, there were just the old themes that sort of grow old on you faster than gym socks.<br /><br />My only gripe is that getting all of my posts imported from a Wordpress platform is rather difficult. I'm tempted to just start from a clean slate, but I have tons of notes from my old posts and I'd like to see them all from one site.
