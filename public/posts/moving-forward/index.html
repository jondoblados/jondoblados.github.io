  <h1>Moving Forward</h1>
  <p>In a month&rsquo;s time, I would be transferring offices again. I started from a very technical department, under the administration cluster. A year and about 3 months later, I was given the privilege to transfer to one of the most influential and authoritative departments in the academic cluster. It was still a split engagement, with me going back and forth these two offices.</p>
<p>And for almost 2 years, I improved processes, handled, battled, and took care of hundreds of scenarios, cases, and situations that seem to always come with the university seasons. I became cognizant of academic procedures and with this knowledge came the understanding of many realities that I vowed to try to fix, given the chance, and if I can.</p>
<p>I will miss being up to my neck deep in operations and in SLMIS. But I think I will miss more being in the company of great people who, inspite of erecting a facade of sternness in all their dealings, turned out to be really cool and happy persons. I will always have their friendship and can always count on them even if I would no longer spend most of the day with them.</p>
<p>Movement is good. But moving forward is always better because you can always look back and see everything you&rsquo;ve done. :D</p>
