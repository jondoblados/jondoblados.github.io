      <description>I have again changed the look of my tech blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve actually mulled over this for quite some time since I was also thinking of just moving everything to my own hosted Wordpress install. But, lazy as I am, I was content to tweak as little as I can. Posterous has a few really nice themes built-in so moving my stuff out was really a bad idea.
In case you&amp;rsquo;re curious, here are some of the things that I intend to complete this month:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m doing some major cosmetic changes with this blog; and I&amp;rsquo;m sort of working off this to-do:
1. come up with a manageable set of tags
2. update posts with appropriate tags
3. look for any form of twitter integration
Yes, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be blogging more now. More than anything else, I need the writing exercise.</description>
