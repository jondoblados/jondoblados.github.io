      <description>Our daughter asked to celebrate her birthday a day ahead, with her 8th grade classmates. They had water gun and balloon fights, and bags of holi powder to throw around. They also played frisbee and volleyball on the village streets and watched scary movies when it got dark. There were lots of food too! I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it was going to be so much fun! Thanks to my dear wife for making preparations, especially the cooking and baking.</description>

      <description>We decided to go to Cebu and spend Christmas this year with my parents and brother. I suppose it has been more than 15 years since we last celebrated Christmas together. The trip was really stressful because it was passenger season. But it was really worth lugging heavy bags since the cousins got to goof off and have a lot of fun, and the grandparents got to see all of their grandchildren in one place.</description>

      <description>Miguel and Isabel goofing off in front of the laptop. They discovered the 4-shot option and started taking pictures by themselves.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t mind if I start posting more pictures here. I’ve really been keeping myself from posting these to Facebook, which was the natural tendency, no thanks to endless egging by the family. But no. It’s been a couple of years now that I’ve wanted to steer clear from FB when it comes to posting pictures; especially of family.</description>

      <description>Since we moved apartments, the little man started doing facial expressions that always gets us wondering how he got them. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried capturing these expressions with a camera but it&amp;rsquo;s a lot harder than simply having the phone or the point-and-shoot handy at all times.
Well today was a treat. He fired up one facial expression, and let me take a picture! Yay!

      <description>Miguel has this rather curious dance step somewhere just before the refrain of the dance track The Time (Dirty Bit) by BEP. Not his full dance though since he was busy running around doing other stuff. :D

      <description>We love Dimsum Diner, but we gotta start learning to keep ourselves from eating there too often. Why? We&amp;rsquo;re all high risk people, that&amp;rsquo;s why.
In this set, my sister-in-law was playing around with the camera settings, which explains the no-flash feature. Will try to do another shoot next time and will play with ISO and WB. Not a DSLR. Lugging that with us during family eat-outs is overkill.

In a month or so he&amp;rsquo;ll be too big to fit in his laundry basket. He has his eye on the bigger hamper in our room.

He runs around and does the &amp;ldquo;happy feet&amp;rdquo;. He also likes running while on top of the air bed, but I can&amp;rsquo;t get any video of that yet as I&amp;rsquo;m too busy going after him lest he bounce too hard and hit the wall.</description>

Thank you Auntie. Indeed he&amp;rsquo;s blessed to have an Ate who is so fond of him. She&amp;rsquo;s as much of a blessing to us as well. :)</description>

Spur of the moment thing. I was never really good with &amp;ldquo;anticipation&amp;rdquo; so didn&amp;rsquo;t take a better recording gadget with us. We didn&amp;rsquo;t think Miguel was going to point at the carousel since he would normally ignore this. I guess he&amp;rsquo;s starting to appreciate things around him more, now that he&amp;rsquo;s walking&amp;hellip;and running&amp;hellip;and stumbling.</description>
