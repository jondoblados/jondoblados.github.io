<p>You&rsquo;re welcome, Jon.  Having suffered form DHF myself, I know the hardships and trials that come with it.  This was a big reason for me to decide to become a blood donor.  It flows within us to give, and flows through us to save others.  While I can&rsquo;t necessarily donate - being on the other side of the world - what I can give is support and encouragement, as well as a call to potential blood donors as well.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in you to give.  There is no grater gift than the gift of life&rdquo;.</p>

<p>New WP theme! Twenty Eleven. Are you still using PressWork for WP, or is this off of WP.com, or for extra g33k points - is this now a self-hosted WP install on server? :P</p>
<p>I kinda liked the feel of your previous theme.</p>
<p>Where have your Pages gone? These are all Posts in Categories now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hosting this on and off from my hosting account since 2006, since I&rsquo;ve been trying out the other services, e.g. tumblr, posterous, blogger, wordpress.com, etc. I&rsquo;m still picking a new theme to use and will most likely set up pages once more.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>in behalf of my husband, Robert, you&rsquo;re welcome and thank you also. God is so good!</p>

<p>Cool. Of all platforms you&rsquo;ve mentioned, I think WordPress is the most flexible and has the most mileage in terms of getting results.</p>
<p>BTW, I view-sourced you and got the Klout iframe. Haha. I couldn&rsquo;t find it anywhere on the Klout site, nor any good WP widget plugins for it. KISS principle wins.</p>

<p>I havent been logging in facebook as much as I want to, and its just now that Im learning about this ordeal you have been through. Jonas, Im just so very very glad that your ok. It may be belated, but I will pray for your continued recovery. It saddens and shames me that Im just learning about this important event in my important friend´s life after everything is over and after he got home. Im glad you found solace in Him in your time of trial. I will would like it very much to be updated in your progress, so please dont be stingy in posting your progress here once in a while. Say hello to your Dad and Mom for me, and will surely visit you in CDO next time Im there in the Phils. Maybe we can go and visit the Snake Cove, you being a roadwarrior and stuff. :P Keep strong and have faith, my neighbor :) You will soon be lifting your kid again like how Our Father lifted you&hellip;</p>

<p>Thanks so much, Don! When are you planning to come home? We&rsquo;ll have to look for a new Snake Cove here in CDO haha. Thank you for praying for me.</p>
