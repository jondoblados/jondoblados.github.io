			<p><em>If I pointed you to another blog of mine, would you visit that as much, considering that it would have mostly techno babble in it, and that it won&rsquo;t have the indispensable &ldquo;my friends&rdquo; link (because it&rsquo;s not on LJ)?</em></p>
<p>Pardon me, I never thought I&rsquo;d be quoting myself this early. =). I just feel like I got to explain myself. I&rsquo;ve been on LJ since 2000. There&rsquo;s a high level of pride associated with web logging that early, and I know most of us have been around and can relate to this feeling. But given that after a few years, you get your own server to use and become productive with, I doubt if you will be able to resist favoring the higher level of customization afforded to you. Now I won&rsquo;t start comparing web logging tools and facilities because I can&rsquo;t. LJ is using established methods and protocols and have carved a niche in the blogosphere. In fact, I personally think LJ should be getting royalties just by being around when web logging was still at its infancy. The rest are, let&rsquo;s just say, &ldquo;learning&rdquo; from the LJ experience.</p>
<p>My concern is not technical or feature-relevant. It&rsquo;s more of an emotional strain, something akin to the feeling of having to part with something of sentimental value. I&rsquo;m having difficulty keeping up with my updating responsibilities in LJ. Since maintaining our servers here are part of daily work, I find it easier to blog on my server, especially that I use emacs plannerMode. Eventually, I feel bad because I am able to diligently update my planner and my tech blog, but not my LJ. I feel like I&rsquo;ve abandoned my LJ for the umpteenth time. I try and put in some updates there, but you know, that thing that got me started on LJ years ago, isn&rsquo;t there anymore. I find it hard to collect thoughts and put them down on a worthy LJ post.</p>
<p>My only worry is that if I decide to become a more efficient (tech) blogger, I would have to wean myself from LJ, but not from my friends of course. I don&rsquo;t have that many people on my friends list, but that&rsquo;s hardly a concern. If I may say this, I am quite certain that those who are in my friends list are very priceless treasure chests - overflowing with intellect, maturity, and experience, all of which I will not get anywhere else in this lifetime. I&rsquo;m just hoping that even if I do move on, they will still be around. =)</p>
<p>But again, I&rsquo;m just wondering, ergo the quoted question that opened this entry. Nothing is definite as of yet, and I may decide to keep (read: maintain) both after all. Oh well. The next time I start thinking aloud, <strong>batukan nyo nga ako please</strong>. Thanks.</p>
