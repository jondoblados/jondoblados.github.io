We partnered with the Kinaadman Research Center (KRC) and through the auspices of Dr. Ester Raagas, Director of the KRC, 67.7% of the entire university faculty population who were also research grantees, were able to learn about Google Drive.<br/><br/><a name='more'></a><br/><br/>The workshop focused on emphasizing the features of Google Drive and Google+ that are applicable for rapid data gathering, information sharing, collaborative work, and documentation.<br/><br/>We would like to thank Dr. Raagas and her team, as well as the Research and Outreach Cluster of Xavier University for their support.
