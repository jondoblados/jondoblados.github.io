I have recently tried out <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> for my requirements. I fell in love with it just about immediately. <a href="http://kluggers.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Miko</a> has expressed disgust at my trolling, but really, I haven't even started flaming other products. Not that I plan to. After all, I have started web logging in LJ, so there's /dev/null chance that I'll favor another over this one.<br/><br/>I'm giving myself a few more weeks to play around with it. I'm just happy that I have a server that I can commandeer at any time. I'll be content if an application I need uses GPL, and as long as I am afforded a high level of customization.
