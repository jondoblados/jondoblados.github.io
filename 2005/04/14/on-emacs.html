I have been trying to find time to install Emacs (temporarily) on jjd because I really want to get my planner running asap. It's a good thing that there is currently a good following for this editor, especially when add-on functionality is introducted: like <a href="http://sacha.free.net.ph">PlannerMode</a>, which I believe will be a very good tool for me. It will allow the conception of collaborative input/development for tasks and projects.<br/><br/>TODO:<br/><ul><br/><li>1. Install Emacs. On Ubuntu or any Debian-based distribution of Linux, type "apt-get  install emacs21". On Windows, download and unpack the fullbin  archive from  <code>http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/emacs-21.3-fullbin-i386.tar.gz</code> (Unpack with Winzip/WinRAR).</li><br/><li>2. Start Emacs.</li><br/><li>3. Make a directory for your Emacs Lisp files. Could be <code>~/elisp</code> or  <code>C:elisp</code>, or something like that.</li><br/><li>4. Download the stable version of Planner from  <code>http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/sacha-stable.tar.gz</code>.  Unpack this in Emacs Lisp directory. Directories will be:  <code>~/elisp/emacs-wiki</code>, <code>~/elisp/planner</code>, and <code>~/elisp/remember</code>.</li><br/><li>5. Read through the instructions at  <code>http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerModeQuickStart</code><br/>  or the documentation at  <code>http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/doc/dev/planner/planner-el.html </code>.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/>Sacha concurs with several other developers I know, in that Emacs is actually less intimidating than most people think it is. The bigger concern here now is getting the right time in space for playing around with Emacs.
