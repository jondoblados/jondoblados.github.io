<p>The authors have sufficiently summarized the study by including the
purpose, methods, results, and conclusions or summary. The study has
identified positional error correction as their purpose, with the
objective of determining if the errors in geographic encoding could
impact results. The study focused on the discussion of the ability of
GIS-based applications to locate residential addresses as closely as
possible with the proposed alternative method of geographic encoding
using residential property parcel data, instead of the automated
geographic encoding.</p>
<p>The study emphasized on the application of GIS-based systems in public
health, and how important precision in geographic encoding is to
ensuring that public health studies are not compromised. There is
extensive literature review on geographic encoding. The authors have
noted that the underlying concepts and theories of this study have been
documented in other studies, in that they were able to present the
problem and justify the need for research. The study also indicates that
there was limited public information on positional error correction,
further emphasizing the need for research.</p>
<p>The problem statement has clearly identified what needs investigation,
which emphasized on finding out if positional errors could impact public
health data analysis results. As a solution, the authors have proposed
their method of geographic encoding, which they expect to address these
concerns.</p>
<p>The authors were able to specifically indicate their methods for
collection of geographic data, beginning with residential addresses.
This data is used as a starting point for geographic encoding and
analysis. The authors indicated some exceptions, which according to
them, will greatly increase positional errors in any geographic encoding
method because of some missing details in the geographic data. The
geographic encoding process was presented, together with the validation
methods that were used in showing how much positional error resulted
from the geographic encoding methods used. The authors were likewise
specific in the analysis methods that they used for the study.</p>
<p>Although quite brief, the authors were able to present the results of
their study well, using tables to compare positional errors between the
geographic encoding methods used. The researchers were also very
thorough in their discussion of their findings, pointing out the obvious
improvements in positional error correction with their proposed method
of geographic encoding. They also made suggestions as to how parcel
points can be standardized, because the encoding and storage of this
data is done by the local government and may not exist in similar
formats.</p>
<p>The authors made recommendations for improvements, stating that their
study is localized and may not be reflective of the level of positional
error that the current geographic encoding method has, using
topographically integrated geographic encoding and reference files.</p>
