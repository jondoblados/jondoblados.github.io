I had a good consultation session with my mentor last Saturday and I got great advise for my thesis. I'm planting my foot on GIS and applications, but the whole gamut of GIS is fairly large so I had to zero in on what I really wanted to focus on. Future research prospects on GIS led me to look up Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to as <a href="http://geni.ath.cx/grass.html">GRASS</a>. It's so cool because for starters, it's GPLed, and it will run on PostgreSQL. It's primarily designed for Linux so I need to have <a href="http://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> run on the host that I will be using to interface with our Linux and non-Linux backends.<p />In a nutshell, my thesis will be concentrating on GIS and data warehouse integration. Should there be an existing or current data warehouse for me to work on, I should be able to model the integration, using the appropriate schema. Should there be no data warehouse, I will have to model from scratch and present and enforce the design.
