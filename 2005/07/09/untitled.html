Apparently, I'm still too busy to update my journal with anything other than tech or work related stuff. So what gives? I'm still trying to get our new vClass firewall configured right. Nothing makes sense anymore, so I'm asking for tech support from the manufacturer. The supplier here doesn't know shit about what they're selling. I'm starting to dread the day when I have to tell the boss "I said this before; we should have gone BSD for our firewalling requirements!" Yak-yak. Don't you just luv finger-pointing?<br/><br/>Well enough of that. I was supposed to start posting course work for my masterals last week. I have over 6 articles/commentaries to do. *groan* Better start working.
