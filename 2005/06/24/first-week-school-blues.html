I got really dissed last night waiting for instructors to report for class. It almost seemed prank-like to me, because we were all waiting for this guy to show up, and just a few minutes before we were afforded a free cut, somebody got SMS from the instructor, apologizing that he wasn't going to make it (again). It probably came late because of network lag, but I'd glady discount that because it was a 3-hr class and we waited for almost an hour for the cut.<br/><br/>As I was not used to waiting (and doing nothing), I whipped out my notebook and started scribbling diagrams and policy tables for the firewall I was configuring for the last 3 days. Looking at these notes now, I'm glad I did them last night. I came in this morning sort of blank...and couldn't remember what I did yesterday. Creepy.<br/><br/>Instructors better report tonight!<br/><br/><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><br/><img alt="" src="http://blogsurvey.media.mit.edu/images/survey-science.gif" /><br/></div>
