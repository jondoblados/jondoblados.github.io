My wife had a miscarriage; and we didn't know she was pregnant until her fallopian tube ruptured and had to be operated on. It was stupefying to learn about the pregnancy only when we got to the ER, but because of her recent hormonal treatment, we have gotten used to negative pregnancy test results and her very irregular monthly cycle, which, according to her OB, was just the body's natural reaction to the withdrawal from the hormones.<br/><br/>Anyway, last May 30, at around 7pm, she started feeling faint and had these pangs of pain in the abdomen. She believed it was just another case of gastritis, or something similar to that. But by 12mn, she had felt so weak and her blood pressure dropped so low that she almost immediately went into shock. I rushed her to the hospital and was operated on quickly. Her being a doctor's daughter helped a lot, because we didn't go through usual pre-op hospital policies. It was a blessing too because if she had been opened up 30 minutes later, it would've been fatal for her.<br/><br/>She still has one good tube, so we can still have another baby. Maybe next year. Nonetheless, PhilHeath will pay up only for the first two children, whether the babies reach full term or not. Ugh.
