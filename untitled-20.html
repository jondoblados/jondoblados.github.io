            <p>My wife had a miscarriage; and we didn't know she was pregnant until her
fallopian tube ruptured and had to be operated on. It was stupefying to
learn about the pregnancy only when we got to the ER, but because of her
recent hormonal treatment, we have gotten used to negative pregnancy
test results and her very irregular monthly cycle, which, according to
her OB, was just the body's natural reaction to the withdrawal from the
hormones.  </p>
<p>Anyway, last May 30, at around 7pm, she started feeling faint and had
these pangs of pain in the abdomen. She believed it was just another
case of gastritis, or something similar to that. But by 12mn, she had
felt so weak and her blood pressure dropped so low that she almost
immediately went into shock. I rushed her to the hospital and was
operated on quickly. Her being a doctor's daughter helped a lot, because
we didn't go through usual pre-op hospital policies. It was a blessing
too because if she had been opened up 30 minutes later, it would've been
fatal for her.  </p>
<p>She still has one good tube, so we can still have another baby. Maybe
next year. Nonetheless, PhilHeath will pay up only for the first two
children, whether the babies reach full term or not. Ugh.</p>
