I just made the first step towards moving my whole blog to GitHub and going all static! Content is generated by <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a>, a static site generator, written in Python. Why GitHub, you ask? While I can always push the static content to any of my existing web hosts, there's a touch of geekness in writing using my favorite editor and publishing by git commits and pushes; thus GitHub. <br /><br />Also, it's this year that I'm planning to pick up Python programming again, for devops reasons. I don't actually remember the last time I was this excited to post an update!
