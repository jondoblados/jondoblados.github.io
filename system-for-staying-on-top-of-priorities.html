  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I've tried a lot of productivity tools to get better control over my
ever-bloating task lists, and none have been as effective for me, as
using Gmail with the GTDInbox add-on, and Google Tasks. How I make these
work for me is a result of several months of trials, using Google Tasks
initially, then with custom labeling and automatic label switching with
GTDInbox.</p>
<p>The goal was simple, and that was to attain inbox zero at least once a
day. GTDInbox allows me to mark or tag emails containing tasks with
action, wait-for, delegated, and finished. After the emails are tagged,
they get added to Google Tasks, so that I'll have an easy way to pull up
a related email for a particular task. Lastly, these emails get
archived, keeping the goal of inbox zero in mind, always.</p>
<p>What tools do you use, and have you already gotten into a rhythm of
using these efficiently while working?</p>
