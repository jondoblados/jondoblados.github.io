    <p>Mae was supposed to have given birth already, but all she ever had were
a few minutes of labor, and they’d disappear and won’t come back until
after a few hours.  The baby’s already a 7+ pounder and all he wants to
do is eat more I guess.  He just keeps kicking until Mae munches on
something.  Definitely, we don’t want him growing as big as Kysa when
she came out; at 9.4 pounds, normal delivery! (Yeah, my wife’s a wonder
woman)</p>
<p>I can sense that she’s really tired and wants to get it over and done
with.  Even our daughter’s getting impatient.  Her exams are about done,
and tomorrow, we head back to CDO.  My dilemma now is scheduling my
paternity leave, because obviously, I couldn’t file for one before Mae
gives birth.  So we’ll see.  I’m all excited to get home!</p>
