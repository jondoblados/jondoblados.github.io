It’s one of <a href="http://www.vtechuk.com/">Vtech’s</a> multi-awarded preschool consoles and one of the best educational toys around.<p />It’s called the <a href="http://www.vtechuk.com/products-and-accessories/vsmile-tv-learning-system-pink-new/">V.Smile TV Learning System</a> (the ones they’re selling now are new models), and it’s in pink! It also comes with the <a href="http://www.vtechuk.com/products-and-accessories/dora-the-explorer-doras-fix-it-adventure/">Dora’s Fix-it Adventure</a> game cartridge.<p />We’re selling it for only P4,000, after we’ve taken off 20% from the original retail price. It is practically brand new as it is barely used, and it’s readily available for anyone here in the Philippines.<p />There will be no shipping charges if you’re in Cebu or in Cagayan de Oro; meaning if you’re somewhere else, we’ll have it couriered to you and you just pay COD for shipping.<p />If you’re interested, and would like to buy, please email me privately (jon at doblados dot net)</p>
