Mariel Rodriguez makes this reality TV show "watchable". Half past midnight since the new season launched and the server is already borked! Good thing I got to grab this pic of Mariel before it went down (it seems to be failing intermittently...but what can you expect from an M$ OS anyway?)<p />Here's the error I see:<br /><h2><span style="font-size: 85%;"><i>Could not load file or assembly 'BizModules.UltraPhotoGallery' or one of its dependencies.
