<div>i haven't been updating for several important, albeit lousy reasons.<p />work has been keeping me up at nights and i feel that if i were to write entries, i wouldn't be making much sense.<p />technobabble is fun, but i've long outgrown this preference for writing. call it a maturing of sorts, and i'm now ready to take things (read: blogging) to higher levels<p />i've almost completely forgotten about deepest sender, a cool firefox <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1811">extension </a>for blogging, and it's great to be using it again<br /></div>
