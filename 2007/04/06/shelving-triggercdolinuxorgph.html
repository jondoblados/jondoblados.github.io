<p>I am officially bringing down my old tech blog after Holy Week. It has virtually become a sinkhole for all kinds of spam links and I have barely done anything to keep it up-to-date.</p> <p>Two&nbsp;of the milestones that I've unknowingly and unwittingly accomplished would include (in order, sorry):</p> <p>1. PR6 (yea, before it went offline for almost a month, and before Google deployed new algorithms sometime in Feb)</p> <p>2. 20,453 spam comments since I replaced my Wordpress.com API key sometime in Nov, 2006.</p> <p>Beginning today, I will post techie stuff in this blog. It's the same ol' renamed-a-hundred-times Blogger account, but with a different twist, now that it's using a personalized domain.</p> <p>Fear not, for&nbsp;my old Blogger URI will still work. I'm just not sure if you will be redirected or if there will be a rewrite. TODO: find out how Blogger does this.</p>
