<p>Honestly, I haven't done any coding in the last 4 months, which is really odd, because I never thought I'd be this detached from programming. But I guess there's more to life than just developing or sustaining&nbsp;passion for singulars. So much for trying not to stay generalist.</p> <p>So I have this personal domain now, and I'm just glad google apps isn't as stiff with the applications anymore. The new interface totally rocks too. I just need to host the domain somewhere, for&nbsp;sites and blogs and stuff.</p> <p>If you're family, and you have a blogger account,&nbsp;I can get you your custom domain working.&nbsp;The default blogspot.com&nbsp;publishing URL will&nbsp;redirect to your custom domain, so I guess you won't be losing any visitors.</p> <p>I'm not that sure about this, but I feel that there will be&nbsp;noticeable changes in how your blog fares with SE's. Some SEO stuff that I've picked up tell me you can't have same content in multiple&nbsp;sites, similar to double-posting.&nbsp;Seems like you can get penalized for that. Question is, will&nbsp;the application of this redirecting exercise on blog a (that has already been indexed) be seen as&nbsp;same content with blog b (which is where blog a will redirect to, if and only if you decide on a custom domain), from a search engine's view?</p> <p>Anyway, I need a host. :)&nbsp;Ironically, I handle dozens of hosts; but I can't get anywhere close to those (all dedicated servers..boohoohoo) without first coughing up lots of cash. Yea I suppose I could just code for it.</p>
