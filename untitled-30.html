onyks: just a thought, man. thought i'd let u and other open-source
advocates read this. :)

Mr. Richard Stallman in his article: [The Free Software Community After
20 Years: With great but incomplete success, what
now?](http://www.newsforge.com/software/04/01/05/1146229.shtml?tid=150&tid=82)
said, and i quote:  



> *"If you take as your goal the increased popularity of certain free
> software, if you seek to convince more people to use some free
> programs some of the time, you might think those non-free program are
> helpful contributions to that goal. It is hard to dispute the claim
> that their availability helps make GNU/Linux more popular. If the
> widespread use of GNU or Linux is the ultimate goal of our community,
> we should logically applaud all applications that run on it, whether
> free or not.  
>   
> But if our goal is freedom, that changes everything. Users cannot be
> free while using a non-free program. To free the citizens of
> cyberspace, we have to replace those non-free programs, not accept
> them. They are not contributions to our community, they are
> temptations to settle for continuing non-freedom."*

<p>great, huh? let's get that advocacy thingie started! :D</p>
