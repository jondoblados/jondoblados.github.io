  <h1>Thank you!</h1>
  <time datetime=2012-06-13T21:12:00&#43;0800 class="post-date">Wed, Jun 13, 2012</time>
  <p><a href="http://jon.doblados.net/christianity/thank-you/attachment/pltbag/"><img src="http://jon.doblados.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pltbag.jpg" alt="" title="Platelet Concentrate"></a>I am home, and enjoying my second lease in life, one slow day at a time. I have never been hospitalized for something as life-threatening as DHF with complications before, so it&rsquo;s a bit frustrating that even when I&rsquo;m already out of the hospital, I could not move around as much as I want. I could not even attempt to lift and carry my son when he feels like asking me to hoist him up. I can only manage a few hours of work now and what&rsquo;s more disheartening is knowing that I can no longer recoup a week&rsquo;s worth of missed work. Well, that&rsquo;s how it is with us road warriors/freelancers.</p>
<p>But I am alive. I survived my first bout against DHF + pneumonia, and I have God, family, and all the people He used to get to me, to thank for.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m taking this moment to write and thank EVERYONE who reached out, spread the word, contacted other people, prayed, donated blood, consoled my wife, watched over me when everyone else was exhausted, and so much more.</p>
<p>You are all AWESOME and I know God sent you all to remind me that He is POWERFUL and ABLE, and that if He wills it so, my recovery was just there for the taking. I simply had to claim what He has already planned for me.</p>
<p>I may not be able to name everyone and if you&rsquo;re one of them, know that deep in my heart I know you, and God knows you, and He will bless and prosper you a hundred-fold because of your kindness.</p>
<p>To <strong>Robert</strong>, <strong>Nadine</strong>, <strong>Alyssa</strong>, and all those who donated blood and lent us their donor cards (<strong>Sherlabs</strong>, <strong>Ian</strong>, <strong>Ramil</strong>, <strong>Justin</strong>, <strong>Joy</strong>, and <strong>Rogel</strong>), I will be forever indebted to you. <strong>Emee</strong>,** Jeanette**, **Jenipur**, **Butch**, **Romar**, **Marj**, **Alma**, **Eugene**, and **Twinkle**, you have been a great support group. My wife wouldn&rsquo;t have derived as much strength had it not been for your visits and help. To **Sonny Boy**, **Rob**, **Mitch**, and all of Jenipur&rsquo;s friends who shared Mae&rsquo;s posts and helped spread the word, thank you!</p>
<p>To our life group, especially <strong>Ptr. Jones</strong> and <strong>Donna</strong>, who have constantly prayed for us, thank you for visiting and for helping Mae through her most trying times. <strong>Ptr. Janssen</strong> and everyone else who prayed for me @VictoryCDO, thank you so much. <strong>Ptr. Babes Mendoza</strong>, thank you po for being there on day 1 and for praying for me.</p>
<p>To my kababata&rsquo;s, neighbors, and friends from back in LIDE, thank you for all of your prayers. <strong>Plang</strong>, <strong>Julie</strong>, <strong>Micmac</strong>, and <strong>Tita Jo</strong>, thank you for sharing Mae&rsquo;s posts and helping get the word around. It&rsquo;s been many years since we left LIDE, yet it feels like we haven&rsquo;t really left. It&rsquo;s amazing because you all still care very much. Thank you for the overwhelming LIDEAN support!</p>
<p>To Mae&rsquo;s friends from UP who shared her statuses and updates, thank you so much for spreading the word. To <strong>EJ</strong>, <strong>Driq</strong>, <strong>Paul</strong>, <strong>Joseph</strong>, <strong>Sherwin</strong>, <strong>Sunshine</strong>, <strong>Dulce</strong>, and all my friends in Twitter, Shell-Matrix, and other online communities, you guys rock. Thank you for your prayers and well-wishes. To my colleagues at work who prayed for me and sent well-wishes, thank you so much!</p>
<p>To <strong>Fely</strong>, my mother, thank you for flying to CDO and helping with watch duty. Your presence helped Mae muster enough strength to keep fighting for us. To my father, <strong>Lucilo</strong>, and brother, <strong>Jeffrey</strong>, thank you for the calls and words of encouragement. To my father-in-law <strong>Elben</strong>, thank you for making sure my needs are met and for rushing to and from the blood bank, the hospital, and the house. To my mother-in-law <strong>Juliet</strong>, thank you for making those important calls to fellow doctors and for keeping the nurses on their toes by calling the station often for updates and instructions. Special thanks to <strong>Dr. Reuben Sedigo</strong> for checking on me twice each day. Those visits meant so much to us. And most importantly, to my doctor/specialist, <strong>Dr. Gina Akiat</strong>, who did so much for us and for always reassuring Mae that things are going to be fine.</p>
<h2 id="and-to-my-wife-mae-thank-you-for-never-leaving-my-side-i-know-you-said-i-should-fight-and-thats-what-ill-do-ill-keep-fighting-for-you-and-our-kids-and-yes-ill-learn-to-stop-and-smell-the-flowers-once-in-a-while-i-love-you-so-much">And to my wife <strong>Mae</strong>, thank you for never leaving my side. I know you said I should fight and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll keep fighting for you and our kids, and yes, I&rsquo;ll learn to stop and smell the flowers once in a while. I love you so much!</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re welcome, Jon.  Having suffered form DHF myself, I know the hardships and trials that come with it.  This was a big reason for me to decide to become a blood donor.  It flows within us to give, and flows through us to save others.  While I can&rsquo;t necessarily donate - being on the other side of the world - what I can give is support and encouragement, as well as a call to potential blood donors as well.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in you to give.  There is no grater gift than the gift of life&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You are blessed! Take care and enjoy the flowers. =)</p>

<p>New WP theme! Twenty Eleven. Are you still using PressWork for WP, or is this off of WP.com, or for extra g33k points - is this now a self-hosted WP install on server? :P</p>
<p>I kinda liked the feel of your previous theme.</p>
<p>Where have your Pages gone? These are all Posts in Categories now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hosting this on and off from my hosting account since 2006, since I&rsquo;ve been trying out the other services, e.g. tumblr, posterous, blogger, wordpress.com, etc. I&rsquo;m still picking a new theme to use and will most likely set up pages once more.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>in behalf of my husband, Robert, you&rsquo;re welcome and thank you also. God is so good!</p>

<p>Cool. Of all platforms you&rsquo;ve mentioned, I think WordPress is the most flexible and has the most mileage in terms of getting results.</p>
<p>BTW, I view-sourced you and got the Klout iframe. Haha. I couldn&rsquo;t find it anywhere on the Klout site, nor any good WP widget plugins for it. KISS principle wins.</p>

<p>I havent been logging in facebook as much as I want to, and its just now that Im learning about this ordeal you have been through. Jonas, Im just so very very glad that your ok. It may be belated, but I will pray for your continued recovery. It saddens and shames me that Im just learning about this important event in my important friend´s life after everything is over and after he got home. Im glad you found solace in Him in your time of trial. I will would like it very much to be updated in your progress, so please dont be stingy in posting your progress here once in a while. Say hello to your Dad and Mom for me, and will surely visit you in CDO next time Im there in the Phils. Maybe we can go and visit the Snake Cove, you being a roadwarrior and stuff. :P Keep strong and have faith, my neighbor :) You will soon be lifting your kid again like how Our Father lifted you&hellip;</p>

<p>Thanks so much, Don! When are you planning to come home? We&rsquo;ll have to look for a new Snake Cove here in CDO haha. Thank you for praying for me.</p>
