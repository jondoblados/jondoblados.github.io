  <h1>Honor God, Make Disciples</h1>
  <time datetime=2012-10-15T00:48:00&#43;0800 class="post-date">Mon, Oct 15, 2012</time>
  <p>A couple of months ago, I started attending this workshop/training for leaders at Victory CDO. It&rsquo;s called Training for Victory (T4V), and it was a once-a-week engagement for about 10 weeks; although it took longer than that because of several holidays around that time. We graduated and were commissioned, not as pastors, but as servants who will lead people to take on a personal relationship with Christ. By God&rsquo;s grace, I was also the recipient of the Award for Excellence during the ceremonies.</p>
<p>All of the learnings I gained during the training has greatly guided me in my walk with Jesus Christ today. You see, I&rsquo;ve constantly struggled with finding time for prayer, or for studying His Word. I&rsquo;ve always had some reason or excuse to do these at a later time. Eventually, I&rsquo;d end up not doing them anymore because work after all, takes a big chunk off my day; and I have to spend the rest of the day for family and for resting.</p>
<p>But the Tuesday sessions brought back a discipline of study that I thought I&rsquo;ve lost. I&rsquo;ve realized that just like with office work, or with project &ldquo;sprints&rdquo;, I can also discipline myself to do 10-15 minutes of focused time for prayer, meditation, or Bible study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve greatly benefited from this. Not only have I deepened my relationship with Christ, but I have also begun to see and feel a change in myself, in how I perceive prayer and what it can do for me and my family, and in how I should conduct myself, whether I&rsquo;m in the company of others or family. There is no secret formula for this. If you want to deepen your relationship with God and live a life of victory, let me know. I&rsquo;d be more than happy to talk about this with you (over coffee perhaps?).</p>
