      <description>In my previous employment, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any problems with submitting reports, practically because we used a time management/monitoring tool and the reports sort of generated by themselves. So when submitting daily reports isn&amp;rsquo;t the norm here at the unit, quarterly reports become quite tricky.
I&amp;rsquo;ve resorted to referring to Google Calendar as most of the stuff we do are usually scheduled. I&amp;rsquo;ve also thought of logging everything on a text file and have pelican publish this to my website.</description>

      <description>Miguel got real bored at home and wanted to go and meet his classmates. Since school doesn&amp;rsquo;t start until the 7th, I decided to take him with me to the office. He immediately got busy with the miniclip games and ignored Mjolnir the whole time![gallery type=&amp;ldquo;rectangular&amp;rdquo; ids=&amp;ldquo;3167,3166&amp;rdquo;]</description>
