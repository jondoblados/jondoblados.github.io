      <title>Apple Announces MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues</title>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t think there was going to be any hope for my early 2011 MacBook Pro, which had GPU-related problems after only about a year of use. The only obvious option I had was to buy a replacement laptop. But Apple seems to have been receiving a lot of reports that they&amp;rsquo;ve launched a repair progam that will fix the graphics problem for free.
If you bought a 15-inch or 17-inch MacBook Pro between early 2011 and end of 2013, as well as the first two generations of the Retina models, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck.</description>

      <description>End users complain because the system isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;user-friendly&amp;rdquo;. FYI, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be that way. It&amp;rsquo;s the only way we can guarantee that the system will still be helpful 25 years from now.</description>

      <title>[repost] System for staying on top of priorities</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve tried a lot of productivity tools to get better control over my ever-bloating task lists, and none have been as effective for me, as using Gmail with the GTDInbox add-on, and Google Tasks. How I make these work for me is a result of several months of trials, using Google Tasks initially, then with custom labeling and automatic label switching with GTDInbox.
The goal was simple, and that was to attain inbox zero at least once a day.</description>

      <title>Export TweetDeck groups in Ubuntu</title>

      <description>If you have multiple installs of TweetDeck on different computers, I bet you wished there were ways to save the groups you set up. These groupings are not saved in your Twitter profile, but are kept in a local database in your computer. This means that for each install of TweetDeck, you will have to re-set up your groups, and any changes won&amp;rsquo;t replicate to your other installs.This post about copying TweetDeck settings in Windows explains this in detail, and I have been able to do the same for Ubuntu, replicating TweetDeck settings across 3 machines.</description>

      <description>I was trying to remove AgileAgenda after fiddling with it for a week and deciding it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to cut it. There&amp;rsquo;s no Adobe Air Application &amp;ldquo;uninstaller&amp;rdquo; in the menu, and search engine results usually point to Mac lurv, or not.Â Seems like uninstalling Air apps on OSX is bloody.I did find this nice article on removing Adobe Air on Linux and gave it (well parts of it) a shot.jon@jedi-ntbk:/opt$ sudo dpkg -S /opt/*</description>
