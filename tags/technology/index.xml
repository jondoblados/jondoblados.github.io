      <title>Apple Announces MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues</title>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t think there was going to be any hope for my early 2011 MacBook Pro, which had GPU-related problems after only about a year of use. The only obvious option I had was to buy a replacement laptop. But Apple seems to have been receiving a lot of reports that they&amp;rsquo;ve launched a repair progam that will fix the graphics problem for free.
If you bought a 15-inch or 17-inch MacBook Pro between early 2011 and end of 2013, as well as the first two generations of the Retina models, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck.</description>

      <description>Just yesterday, August 7, we had our first academe-focused event, which we called &amp;ldquo;Enhancing Research with Google Technologies&amp;rdquo;. We partnered with the Kinaadman Research Center (KRC) and through the auspices of Dr. Ester Raagas, Director of the KRC, 67.7% of the entire university faculty population who were also research grantees, were able to learn about Google Drive.
The workshop focused on emphasizing the features of Google Drive and Google+ that are applicable for rapid data gathering, information sharing, collaborative work, and documentation.</description>

      <description>Last July 20, we had our Diversity and Inclusion event for women, which we called &amp;ldquo;Empowering Women on the Go&amp;rdquo;. We worked with a local JCI chapter, JCI Bai Lawanen, and their members were able to listen to Harriet Fernandez, a director for an IT unit at Xavier University, and Shayryl Mae Ramos, a learning management system administrator, also at Xavier University.
The workshop was on Google Drive and on being able to balance work and home roles.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t written a proper blog entry since 2006. I feel that my recent entries are worthy of post tags that I would consider &amp;ldquo;forgettable&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;archive-able&amp;rdquo; (if there is such a thing).
I so need motivation. Anything to get the old drive for writing flowing in my veins again. I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate any inputs from you. Just leave a comment.
At this stage, I can&amp;rsquo;t say I still want this blog focused on work and tech stuff.</description>

      <description>I’ve tried a lot of productivity tools to get better control over my ever-bloating task lists, and none have been as effective for me, as using Gmail with the GTDInbox add-on, and Google Tasks. How I make these work for me is a result of several months of trials, using Google Tasks initially, then with custom labeling and automatic label switching with GTDInbox.
The goal was simple, and that was to attain inbox zero at least once a day.</description>

      <title>Export TweetDeck groups in Ubuntu</title>
      <link>https://jon.doblados.net/blog/export-tweetdeck-groups-in-ubuntu/</link>

      <guid>https://jon.doblados.net/blog/export-tweetdeck-groups-in-ubuntu/</guid>
      <description>If you have multiple installs of TweetDeck on different computers, I bet you wished there were ways to save the groups you set up. These groupings are not saved in your Twitter profile, but are kept in a local database in your computer. This means that for each install of TweetDeck, you will have to re-set up your groups, and any changes won&amp;rsquo;t replicate to your other installs.
This post about copying TweetDeck settings in Windows explains this in detail, and I have been able to do the same for Ubuntu, replicating TweetDeck settings across 3 machines.</description>

      <description>I was trying to remove AgileAgenda after fiddling with it for a week and deciding it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to cut it. There&amp;rsquo;s no Adobe Air Application &amp;ldquo;uninstaller&amp;rdquo; in the menu, and search engine results usually point to Mac lurv, or not. Seems like uninstalling Air apps on OSX is bloody.
I did find this nice article on removing Adobe Air on Linux and gave it (well parts of it) a shot.</description>

      <description>i haven&amp;rsquo;t been updating for several important, albeit lousy reasons.
work has been keeping me up at nights and i feel that if i were to write entries, i wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be making much sense.
technobabble is fun, but i&amp;rsquo;ve long outgrown this preference for writing. call it a maturing of sorts, and i&amp;rsquo;m now ready to take things (read: blogging) to higher levels
i&amp;rsquo;ve almost completely forgotten about deepest sender, a cool firefox extension for blogging, and it&amp;rsquo;s great to be using it again</description>

      <description>I recently got Ubuntu Feisty Fawn Beta running on my HP Pavilion dv2001tu notebook, and I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with the way it&amp;rsquo;s running. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and have been doing the past month. Nothing out of the ordinary for me, but some of the activities mentioned here could have been keeping you up late at nights, coveting much of the understated successes of
running Ubuntu on HP laptops. If this is indeed so, do let me know your woes and I&amp;rsquo;ll see what I can do to help.</description>
