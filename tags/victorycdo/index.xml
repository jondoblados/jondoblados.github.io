      <description>A couple of months ago, I started attending this workshop/training for leaders at Victory CDO. It&amp;rsquo;s called Training for Victory (T4V), and it was a once-a-week engagement for about 10 weeks; although it took longer than that because of several holidays around that time. We graduated and were commissioned, not as pastors, but as servants who will lead people to take on a personal relationship with Christ. By God&amp;rsquo;s grace, I was also the recipient of the Award for Excellence during the ceremonies.</description>
