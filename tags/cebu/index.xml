      <description>These are some of the pictures I took during the CDO (Cagayan de Oro) and Cebu legs of our 2019 trip to the Philippines. In CDO, we did a joint birthday celebration for our kids since their birthdays are just a week apart. It was a great time to catch up with extended family and friends.
We then flew to Cebu City and spent a couple of days meeting family and close friends.</description>

      <description>We decided to go to Cebu and spend Christmas this year with my parents and brother. I suppose it has been more than 15 years since we last celebrated Christmas together. The trip was really stressful because it was passenger season. But it was really worth lugging heavy bags since the cousins got to goof off and have a lot of fun, and the grandparents got to see all of their grandchildren in one place.</description>
