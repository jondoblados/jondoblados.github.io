      <description>In a month&amp;rsquo;s time, I would be transferring offices again. I started from a very technical department, under the administration cluster. A year and about 3 months later, I was given the privilege to transfer to one of the most influential and authoritative departments in the academic cluster. It was still a split engagement, with me going back and forth these two offices.
And for almost 2 years, I improved processes, handled, battled, and took care of hundreds of scenarios, cases, and situations that seem to always come with the university seasons.</description>
