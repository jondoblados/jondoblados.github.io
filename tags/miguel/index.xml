      <description>I sort of miss being in the backseat. A lot of my goofing off years have been conducted within the confines of the passenger doors, backside of the front seats, and the backseat.</description>

      <description>Miguel and Isabel goofing off in front of the laptop. They discovered the 4-shot option and started taking pictures by themselves.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t mind if I start posting more pictures here. I’ve really been keeping myself from posting these to Facebook, which was the natural tendency, no thanks to endless egging by the family. But no. It’s been a couple of years now that I’ve wanted to steer clear from FB when it comes to posting pictures; especially of family.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve recently decided to cover the whole area where the outdoor canteen was and turn into an activity area. I was supposed to have completed the electrical wiring last Saturday but the materials were delivered at noon and I was already quite content with just spending the afternoon with the kids.
Will post more pictures this week as we try and finish the fascia, flooring, and electrical works.</description>
