      <description>Miguel got real bored at home and wanted to go and meet his classmates. Since school doesn&amp;rsquo;t start until the 7th, I decided to take him with me to the office. He immediately got busy with the miniclip games and ignored Mjolnir the whole time![gallery type=&amp;ldquo;rectangular&amp;rdquo; ids=&amp;ldquo;3167,3166&amp;rdquo;]</description>

      <description>I sort of miss being in the backseat. A lot of my goofing off years have been conducted within the confines of the passenger doors, backside of the front seats, and the backseat.[gallery columns=&amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; type=&amp;ldquo;rectangular&amp;rdquo; ids=&amp;ldquo;3012,3011,3010,3009,3008,3007,3006,3005,3004,3003&amp;rdquo;]</description>

      <description>Miguel and Isabel goofing off in front of the laptop. They discovered the 4-shot option and started taking pictures by themselves.Please don&amp;rsquo;t mind if I start posting more pictures here. I’ve really been keeping myself from posting these to Facebook, which was the natural tendency, no thanks to endless egging by the family. But no. It’s been a couple of years now that I’ve wanted to steer clear from FB when it comes to posting pictures; especially of family.</description>

      <description>Since we moved apartments, the little man started doing facial expressions that always gets us wondering how he got them. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried capturing these expressions with a camera but it&amp;rsquo;s a lot harder than simply having the phone or the point-and-shoot handy at all times.Well today was a treat. He fired up one facial expression, and let me take a picture! Yay![nggallery id=6]</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve recently decided to cover the whole area where the outdoor canteen was and turn into an activity area. I was supposed to have completed the electrical wiring last Saturday but the materials were delivered at noon and I was already quite content with just spending the afternoon with the kids.[nggallery id=5]Will post more pictures this week as we try and finish the fascia, flooring, and electrical works.</description>

Shot with a phone camera. Jon Miguel, who&#39;s only a year and 11 months, trying out the videoke machine and doing some really rad facial expressions while singing. Please do watch the two others below. I didn&#39;t bother editing because I couldn&#39;t get Pitivi to import mp4 files properly.19032011(002).mp4Watch on Posterous19032011(001).mp4Watch on Posterous</description>

      <description>Miguel has this rather curious dance step somewhere just before the refrain of the dance track The Time (Dirty Bit) by BEP. Not his full dance though since he was busy running around doing other stuff. :D&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;movie1_01_01.aviWatch on Posterous</description>

      <description>Earlier today, we let Miguel tag along with us to David&amp;rsquo;s in Divisoria. We weren&amp;rsquo;t sure if Miguel was ready to have his first &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; haircut. After seeing all of us get trimmed by Peter (he&amp;rsquo;s the only one who cuts our hair), it looked like he was okay to get one too, until someone wrapped a barber&amp;rsquo;s cape around his neck and the screeching started. LOL!He did pause a few times to try to smile at the camera through tears.</description>

In a month or so he&#39;ll be too big to fit in his laundry basket. He has his eye on the bigger hamper in our room.

He runs around and does the &#34;happy feet&#34;. He also likes running while on top of the air bed, but I can&#39;t get any video of that yet as I&#39;m too busy going after him lest he bounce too hard and hit the wall.</description>

Spur of the moment thing. I was never really good with &#34;anticipation&#34; so didn&#39;t take a better recording gadget with us. We didn&#39;t think Miguel was going to point at the carousel since he would normally ignore this. I guess he&#39;s starting to appreciate things around him more, now that he&#39;s walking...and running...and stumbling.</description>
