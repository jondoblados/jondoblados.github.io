      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t think there was going to be any hope for my early 2011 MacBook Pro, which had GPU-related problems after only about a year of use. The only obvious option I had was to buy a replacement laptop. But Apple seems to have been receiving a lot of reports that they&amp;rsquo;ve launched a repair program that will fix the graphics problem for free.
If you bought a 15-inch or 17-inch MacBook Pro between early 2011 and end of 2013, as well as the first two generations of the Retina models, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck.</description>
