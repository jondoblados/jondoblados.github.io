      <description>In a month&amp;rsquo;s time, I would be transferring offices again. I started from a very technical department, under the administration cluster. A year and about 3 months later, I was given the privilege to transfer to one of the most influential and authoritative departments in the academic cluster. It was still a split engagement, with me going back and forth these two offices.
And for almost 2 years, I improved processes, handled, battled, and took care of hundreds of scenarios, cases, and situations that seem to always come with the university seasons.</description>

      <title>Got Static!</title>

      <description>I just made the first step towards moving my whole blog to GitHub and going all static! Content is generated by Pelican, a static site generator, written in Python. Why GitHub, you ask? While I can always push the static content to any of my existing web hosts, there&amp;rsquo;s a touch of geekness in writing using my favorite editor and publishing by git commits and pushes; thus GitHub.
Also, it&amp;rsquo;s this year that I&amp;rsquo;m planning to pick up Python programming again, for devops reasons.</description>

      <title>Racking Legacy Servers - Part 1</title>

      <description>Earlier today we scheduled the racking of our old C-Class HP BladeSystem. It used to be wrapped in its own enclosure with wheels to boot, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to have it stand outside the cabinets. So we gave heads up and asked some guys to stay behind after office hours. Thanks to Mona, Eric, Jing, Tim, and Mark(?) for the assist!
Next up, the classic IBM BladeCenter!</description>

      <description>End users complain because the system isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;user-friendly&amp;rdquo;. FYI, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be that way. It&amp;rsquo;s the only way we can guarantee that the system will still be helpful 25 years from now.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way since 2006; but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 2009 that we had a solid team based in CDO. We&amp;rsquo;re not even all sysads, but we love the fact that besides Romar, who has been my friend from way back, it was only after Carlo and Alvin joined GWF did we learn where they&amp;rsquo;re from.

Looking forward to another TBA at the later part of this year, hopefully with more people.</description>

      <description>I have again changed the look of my tech blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve actually mulled over this for quite some time since I was also thinking of just moving everything to my own hosted Wordpress install. But, lazy as I am, I was content to tweak as little as I can. Posterous has a few really nice themes built-in so moving my stuff out was really a bad idea.
In case you&amp;rsquo;re curious, here are some of the things that I intend to complete this month:</description>

      <title>SVN-MantisBT Integration</title>

      <guid>https://jon.doblados.net/blog/svn-mantisbt-integration/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded and installed MantisBT 1.2.3stable on linode2, and after fixing permissions issues, proceeded with the installation. I stopped when I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the same MantisBT version on the old server. It&amp;rsquo;s always better to set up MantisBT on the target server &amp;ldquo;as is&amp;rdquo;, and let the install scripts handle the upgrade.
I&amp;rsquo;m roughly 28% in with a server-to-server SCP of a 79Mb MySQL dump of our bugtracker. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to check with the backups since I felt that a fresh dump is always best; but no, I remembered that several developers preferred working odd hours and they would definitely need the bug tracker up.</description>

      <description>By Jared &amp;ldquo;Lucky&amp;rdquo; Kuolt on September 29, 2010 Like the idea of working on large scale problems? We’re hiring talented engineers, and would love to chat with you – check it out!
 Note: Concurrency, as defined in this article, is the same as it is for The C10k problem: concurrent clients (or sockets).
 At Urban Airship we recently published a blog post about scaling beyond 500,000 concurrent socket connections.</description>

      <title>How to count instances of an IP address in a log file</title>

      <description>I was looking for a quick and painless way to determine what IP addresses used our web app the most and stumbled across this excellent post. I got reminded of the power of the command-line interface and that often, I underestimate the way these commands are supposed to make a sysad&amp;rsquo;s life easier.
So here&amp;rsquo;s a quick tip for counting unique visitors to your web app. Locate your web app&amp;rsquo;s log file and do a quick scan of the last few lines.</description>

      <description>And I got a long way to go. My next step doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen in the next couple of months, and that&amp;rsquo;s when I purchase a terabyte external hard drive for storage purposes.
 Remember back in the 1970s when 200MB was the size of a tire? Now we live in a world of gigbytes and terabytes, and the future will bring zettabytes and yottabytes in everyday life. Hello, future!

      <title>Using non-standard SSH port with TortoiseSVN</title>

      <description>Some of my students reported that they were having problems connecting to their repositories using TortoiseSVN. At first, quick checks from my end didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal what caused these, but I realized soon that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a server issue. It seems like the client software that they were using (TortoiseSVN) didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to make of the svn+ssh://[user]@[ip]:[port]/[repo] URL.
I use RabbitVCS on my Linux boxen and get the same &amp;ldquo;Network connection closed unexpectedly&amp;rdquo; message.</description>

      <description>I use VirtualBox for my server experimenting requirements, and it&amp;rsquo;s just great! Just this morning, I got an error message when I started an FC8 virtual machine.
PIIX3 cannot attach drive to the Secondary Master. VBox status code: -102 (VERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND).
This thread in the forums explains that the virtual machine was looking for a disk that was supposed to be mounted and could not find it. I was using an external DVD drive and had removed it before I shut down the VM.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this problem with Plesk since I started relying heavily on it in 2006. For some reason, after you&amp;rsquo;ve added your client, allocated IP address to client&amp;rsquo;s pool, added a domain, and selecting physical hosting, you get the message:
 Unable to update hosting preferences: hosting update is failed: object ID is invalid
 After getting this error, you get the domain listed, but still requiring set up. Attempting to complete physical hosting setup will give you same result.</description>

      <description>i haven&amp;rsquo;t been updating for several important, albeit lousy reasons.
work has been keeping me up at nights and i feel that if i were to write entries, i wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be making much sense.
technobabble is fun, but i&amp;rsquo;ve long outgrown this preference for writing. call it a maturing of sorts, and i&amp;rsquo;m now ready to take things (read: blogging) to higher levels
i&amp;rsquo;ve almost completely forgotten about deepest sender, a cool firefox extension for blogging, and it&amp;rsquo;s great to be using it again</description>

      <description>I recently got Ubuntu Feisty Fawn Beta running on my HP Pavilion dv2001tu notebook, and I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with the way it&amp;rsquo;s running. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and have been doing the past month. Nothing out of the ordinary for me, but some of the activities mentioned here could have been keeping you up late at nights, coveting much of the understated successes of
running Ubuntu on HP laptops. If this is indeed so, do let me know your woes and I&amp;rsquo;ll see what I can do to help.</description>
