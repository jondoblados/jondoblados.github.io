      <description>In a month&amp;rsquo;s time, I would be transferring offices again. I started from a very technical department, under the administration cluster. A year and about 3 months later, I was given the privilege to transfer to one of the most influential and authoritative departments in the academic cluster. It was still a split engagement, with me going back and forth these two offices.
And for almost 2 years, I improved processes, handled, battled, and took care of hundreds of scenarios, cases, and situations that seem to always come with the university seasons.</description>

      <description>We decided to go to Cebu and spend Christmas this year with my parents and brother. I suppose it has been more than 15 years since we last celebrated Christmas together. The trip was really stressful because it was passenger season. But it was really worth lugging heavy bags since the cousins got to goof off and have a lot of fun, and the grandparents got to see all of their grandchildren in one place.</description>

      <description>Each year, on Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day, I usually surprise my darling wife with a letter/card, or a bouquet of roses. As it was a yearly thing, I knew she sort of expected these surprises; she&amp;rsquo;d look surprised, but I knew she wasn&amp;rsquo;t really. Occasionally, she does get surprised. Like that time back in Cebu when I bought her a rather intricate bouquet of flowers. Her head spun when she found out how much I paid for it.</description>

      <description>Miguel got real bored at home and wanted to go and meet his classmates. Since school doesn&amp;rsquo;t start until the 7th, I decided to take him with me to the office. He immediately got busy with the miniclip games and ignored Mjolnir the whole time![gallery type=&amp;ldquo;rectangular&amp;rdquo; ids=&amp;ldquo;3167,3166&amp;rdquo;]</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve once more moved my blog. This time, it&amp;rsquo;s on my own hosting account and it&amp;rsquo;s back to using WP. Same blog, different flavor now and moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this short discussion with a co-leader in church on going back to blogging, and he pointed out the importance of identifying to a particular niche. I said sure, it&amp;rsquo;s important, but I think I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to separate my technical gibberish from my thoughts and reflections on God and Christianity.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago, I started attending this workshop/training for leaders at Victory CDO. It&amp;rsquo;s called Training for Victory (T4V), and it was a once-a-week engagement for about 10 weeks; although it took longer than that because of several holidays around that time. We graduated and were commissioned, not as pastors, but as servants who will lead people to take on a personal relationship with Christ. By God&amp;rsquo;s grace, I was also the recipient of the Award for Excellence during the ceremonies.</description>

      <description>Miguel and Isabel goofing off in front of the laptop. They discovered the 4-shot option and started taking pictures by themselves.Please don&amp;rsquo;t mind if I start posting more pictures here. I’ve really been keeping myself from posting these to Facebook, which was the natural tendency, no thanks to endless egging by the family. But no. It’s been a couple of years now that I’ve wanted to steer clear from FB when it comes to posting pictures; especially of family.</description>

      <description>I am home, and enjoying my second lease in life, one slow day at a time. I have never been hospitalized for something as life-threatening as DHF with complications before, so it&amp;rsquo;s a bit frustrating that even when I&amp;rsquo;m already out of the hospital, I could not move around as much as I want. I could not even attempt to lift and carry my son when he feels like asking me to hoist him up.</description>

      <description>Since we moved apartments, the little man started doing facial expressions that always gets us wondering how he got them. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried capturing these expressions with a camera but it&amp;rsquo;s a lot harder than simply having the phone or the point-and-shoot handy at all times.Well today was a treat. He fired up one facial expression, and let me take a picture! Yay![nggallery id=6]</description>

Shot with a phone camera. Jon Miguel, who&#39;s only a year and 11 months, trying out the videoke machine and doing some really rad facial expressions while singing.

      <description>We went to Musuan, in Bukidnon. It&amp;rsquo;s home to the &amp;ldquo;boob&amp;rdquo; mountain, hence the name &amp;ldquo;Musuan&amp;rdquo;. Our dear Aunt Celia passed on and relatives from all over convened in CMU (where she was administrator). We spent the night in RR Family Spring Resort in Tubigon, border of Maramag, and after the wake swam in the fresh water pools, braving the intense cold. :D[gallery columns=&amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo; orderby=&amp;ldquo;post_date&amp;rdquo;]&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>Miguel has this rather curious dance step somewhere just before the refrain of the dance track The Time (Dirty Bit) by BEP. Not his full dance though since he was busy running around doing other stuff. :D&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;movie1_01_01.aviWatch on Posterous</description>

      <description>Earlier today, we let Miguel tag along with us to David&amp;rsquo;s in Divisoria. We weren&amp;rsquo;t sure if Miguel was ready to have his first &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; haircut. After seeing all of us get trimmed by Peter (he&amp;rsquo;s the only one who cuts our hair), it looked like he was okay to get one too, until someone wrapped a barber&amp;rsquo;s cape around his neck and the screeching started. LOL!He did pause a few times to try to smile at the camera through tears.</description>

      <description>We love Dimsum Diner, but we gotta start learning to keep ourselves from eating there too often. Why? We&amp;rsquo;re all high risk people, that&amp;rsquo;s why.In this set, my sister-in-law was playing around with the camera settings, which explains the no-flash feature. Will try to do another shoot next time and will play with ISO and WB. Not a DSLR. Lugging that with us during family eat-outs is overkill.[gallery columns=&amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo; orderby=&amp;ldquo;post_date&amp;rdquo;]</description>

      <description>Well here are a couple of shots of our princess, who was trying to finish off her purchases so she can brush teeth and sleep already. She&amp;rsquo;s tried doing some blogging in her spare time (I think this is a good thing for her) and you can follow her here.Nomnomnom! First shot settings were F/7.1, ISO-400, shutter speed of 0.81secNext shot used F/2.8, ISO-400, and shutter speed of 1/10sec. The better shot I think.</description>

In a month or so he&#39;ll be too big to fit in his laundry basket. He has his eye on the bigger hamper in our room.

He runs around and does the &#34;happy feet&#34;. He also likes running while on top of the air bed, but I can&#39;t get any video of that yet as I&#39;m too busy going after him lest he bounce too hard and hit the wall.</description>

Spur of the moment thing. I was never really good with &#34;anticipation&#34; so didn&#39;t take a better recording gadget with us. We didn&#39;t think Miguel was going to point at the carousel since he would normally ignore this. I guess he&#39;s starting to appreciate things around him more, now that he&#39;s walking...and running...and stumbling.</description>

It also comes with the Dora’s Fix-it Adventure game cartridge.We’re selling it for only P4,000, after we’ve taken off 20% from the original retail price. It is practically brand new as it is barely used, and it’s readily available for anyone here in the Philippines.</description>

I just feel like I got to explain myself. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on LJ since 2000. There&amp;rsquo;s a high level of pride associated with web logging that early, and I know most of us have been around and can relate to this feeling.</description>
