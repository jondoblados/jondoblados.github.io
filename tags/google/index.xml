      <description>Back in November last year, the Apps Services Partner that I help with Google Apps Support told me that I was required to take the Google Apps for Work Deployment Specialist certification exam. I learned that Google was going to end the certification program and that I had to take the exam January 5, 2016. It turns out that they were simplifying the Partner Credential Program. All good!
So I took a crash review during the holiday break, read through all Google Apps for Work help articles I could get my hands on, and did self-study on Google Apps Administrator Fundamentals and Deployment Essentials.</description>

      <description>This is our opening salvo for the year. Since we started last year, GBG Cagayan de Oro has been receiving a lot of good feedback from the locals. But we&amp;rsquo;ve put our attention on the areas where we can improve, and I really believe that this mapping event is a step towards that direction. A well-mapped city improves tourism and support services. It also opens numerous planning opportunities for the local government.</description>

      <description>Just yesterday, August 7, we had our first academe-focused event, which we called &amp;ldquo;Enhancing Research with Google Technologies&amp;rdquo;. We partnered with the Kinaadman Research Center (KRC) and through the auspices of Dr. Ester Raagas, Director of the KRC, 67.7% of the entire university faculty population who were also research grantees, were able to learn about Google Drive.
The workshop focused on emphasizing the features of Google Drive and Google+ that are applicable for rapid data gathering, information sharing, collaborative work, and documentation.</description>

      <description>Last July 20, we had our Diversity and Inclusion event for women, which we called &amp;ldquo;Empowering Women on the Go&amp;rdquo;. We worked with a local JCI chapter, JCI Bai Lawanen, and their members were able to listen to Harriet Fernandez, a director for an IT unit at Xavier University, and Shayryl Mae Ramos, a learning management system administrator, also at Xavier University.
The workshop was on Google Drive and on being able to balance work and home roles.</description>

      <description>I am officially bringing down my old tech blog after Holy Week. It has virtually become a sinkhole for all kinds of spam links and I have barely done anything to keep it up-to-date.
Two of the milestones that I&amp;rsquo;ve unknowingly and unwittingly accomplished would include (in order, sorry):
1. PR6 (yea, before it went offline for almost a month, and before Google deployed new algorithms sometime in Feb)
2. 20,453 spam comments since I replaced my Wordpress.</description>
