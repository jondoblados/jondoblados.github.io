      <description>Back in November last year, the Apps Services Partner that I help with Google Apps Support told me that I was required to take the Google Apps for Work Deployment Specialist certification exam. I learned that Google was going to end the certification program and that I had to take the exam January 5, 2016. It turns out that they were simplifying the Partner Credential Program. All good!
So I took a crash review during the holiday break, read through all Google Apps for Work help articles I could get my hands on, and did self-study on Google Apps Administrator Fundamentals and Deployment Essentials.</description>

      <description>I am officially bringing down my old tech blog after Holy Week. It has virtually become a sinkhole for all kinds of spam links and I have barely done anything to keep it up-to-date.
Two&amp;nbsp;of the milestones that I&#39;ve unknowingly and unwittingly accomplished would include (in order, sorry):
1. PR6 (yea, before it went offline for almost a month, and before Google deployed new algorithms sometime in Feb)
2. 20,453 spam comments since I replaced my Wordpress.</description>
