      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve recently decided to cover the whole area where the outdoor canteen was and turn into an activity area. I was supposed to have completed the electrical wiring last Saturday but the materials were delivered at noon and I was already quite content with just spending the afternoon with the kids.
Will post more pictures this week as we try and finish the fascia, flooring, and electrical works.</description>
