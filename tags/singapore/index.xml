      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been over two decades since I last saw Uncle Bong. He would usually drop by Diamond Village in Novaliches, Quezon City to visit Lola Magding and my mother&amp;rsquo;s side of the family there. Back then, I was still in college, and I think he had also just started working, in the automotive industry.
He has since worked in cruise ships and it was a good stroke of fortune when he told me that they would be dry-docking in Singapore.</description>

      <description>Dad and mum, Jen, Rob, Ava, and Rob&amp;rsquo;s parents spent the holidays here in Singapore. For once, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to take that many photos, but everything&amp;rsquo;s been awesome, especially Miguel&amp;rsquo;s and Ava&amp;rsquo;s gift opening.
Luckily, I managed to retrieve some of the most important photos, which are those of dining out! :D</description>

      <description>Dad and Mom dropped by Singapore to celebrate Mae&amp;rsquo;s birthday with us. It was two days of hectic shopping at the IMM, dining out, and cooking for an instant birthday party at the flat with colleagues at work and cousins in SG! Happy birthday, pangga!</description>
