      <description>Miguel and Isabel goofing off in front of the laptop. They discovered the 4-shot option and started taking pictures by themselves.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t mind if I start posting more pictures here. I’ve really been keeping myself from posting these to Facebook, which was the natural tendency, no thanks to endless egging by the family. But no. It’s been a couple of years now that I’ve wanted to steer clear from FB when it comes to posting pictures; especially of family.</description>
