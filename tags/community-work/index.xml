      <description>This is our opening salvo for the year. Since we started last year, GBG Cagayan de Oro has been receiving a lot of good feedback from the locals. But we&#39;ve put our attention on the areas where we can improve, and I really believe that this mapping event is a step towards that direction. A well-mapped city improves tourism and support services. It also opens numerous planning opportunities for the local government.</description>

      <description>Just yesterday, August 7, we had our first academe-focused event, which we called &amp;ldquo;Enhancing Research with Google Technologies&amp;rdquo;. We partnered with the Kinaadman Research Center (KRC) and through the auspices of Dr. Ester Raagas, Director of the KRC, 67.7% of the entire university faculty population who were also research grantees, were able to learn about Google Drive.The workshop focused on emphasizing the features of Google Drive and Google+ that are applicable for rapid data gathering, information sharing, collaborative work, and documentation.</description>

      <description>Last July 20, we had our Diversity and Inclusion event for women, which we called &amp;ldquo;Empowering Women on the Go&amp;rdquo;. We worked with a local JCI chapter, JCI Bai Lawanen, and their members were able to listen to Harriet Fernandez, a director for an IT unit at Xavier University, and Shayryl Mae Ramos, a learning management system administrator, also at Xavier University.The workshop was on Google Drive and on being able to balance work and home roles.</description>
