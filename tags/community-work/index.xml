      <description>This is our opening salvo for the year. Since we started last year, GBG Cagayan de Oro has been receiving a lot of good feedback from the locals. But we&amp;rsquo;ve put our attention on the areas where we can improve, and I really believe that this mapping event is a step towards that direction. A well-mapped city improves tourism and support services. It also opens numerous planning opportunities for the local government.</description>
