    <p>Finally had a little time in my hands, ergo some updates. One week down.
Queen city of the South. Torrential rains. I couldn't be any more bushed
than I currently am right now. Moving residence is definitely top in my
list for most strenuous activities one can go through. It's very
prolonged; and the chores you thought you'd never do again, like wiring
the aircon <em>(Aside: among other things, and did I just forget about the
aircon frame that we hacked??)</em>, well...you end up doing them anyway.
It's by God's grace that I haven't felt the flu creeping in yet. Maybe
it'll never get the chance to.</p>
<p>Special thanks go to my in-laws, who went with us and carried some of
our hand-carried items, to Papa Jun, who's always ready to pick us up
from the port whenever we're in the area, <em>(Aside: guess what, we're
settling down here, but I still hope he'd keep doing this until I get a
car to do this myself...soon.)</em> and to my parents and brother, who lent
us a few (and very important) items to get us by while I pay off the
fridge and aircon.</p>
<p>Papa's out of practice. It's funny because it seemed like we changed
roles already; him assisting me. I'm thankful he stayed up late just to
make sure we finished wiring the darn thing. It was so stiffling hot and
we needed some cooling so we'd get to sleep already.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm up to my neck with work already. It's just one project for
now, but I'm still trying to adjust to a predominantly Windoze
environment. I got a go-ahead from the boss, so I'm going GNULinux over
the weekend. Bliss!</p>
