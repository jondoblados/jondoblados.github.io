    <p>Last July 20, we had our Diversity and Inclusion event for women, which
we called "Empowering Women on the Go". We worked with a local JCI
chapter, JCI Bai Lawanen, and their members were able to listen to
Harriet Fernandez, a director for an IT unit at Xavier University, and
Shayryl Mae Ramos, a learning management system administrator, also at
Xavier University.  </p>
<p>The workshop was on Google Drive and on being able to balance work and
home roles. The attendees were able to get great tips from the speakers
and were able to see how Google Drive may be able to help improve their
lives; as entrepreneurs, as mothers, as women.  </p>
<p>Thank you JCI Bai Lawanen, through President Zeanette Jo Cuevas, for
helping make this event a success!  </p>
