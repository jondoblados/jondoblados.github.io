Back in November last year, the Apps Services Partner that I help with Google Apps Support told me that I was required to take the Google Apps for Work Deployment Specialist certification exam. I learned that Google was going to end the certification program and that I had to take the exam January 5, 2016. It turns out that they were simplifying the Partner Credential Program. All good!<br /><br />So I took a crash review during the holiday break, read through all Google Apps for Work help articles I could get my hands on, and did self-study on Google Apps Administrator Fundamentals and Deployment Essentials.<br /><br />I thought I could wing it with an hour or two of readings each day. Turns out that I had to read, practice, read some more, and recall deployments I was involved in. It was very humbling because I thought I knew a lot, and that if I made sure I understood different deployment use cases, I'd be fine. Boy, was I wrong. I was pulling at my hair trying to recall concepts and best practices around:<br /><ul><li>Mail delivery architectures</li><li>Directory Sync and user provisioning from LDAP servers</li><li>Data migration from Microsoft Exchange, IBM Notes and Domino, and IMAP sources</li><li>Configuration and support for mobile devices</li><li>Security features like SSO, SSL, and compliance settings</li></ul>It took me 84 gruelling minutes to complete the exam, with the proctor stopping the exam a couple of times for camera adjustments. I got too frazzled that I didn't realize I passed the exam because right after I turned it in, the assessing system immediately presented my certificate and badge; and it took a while for that to sink in.<br /><br />Let me know if your company wants to transition to using Google Apps as your email, collaboration, and productivity solution.<br /><img alt="certified-deployment-specialist" height="288" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/712927/web/cert.jpg" width="400" />
