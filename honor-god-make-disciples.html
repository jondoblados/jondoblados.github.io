</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>A couple of months ago, I started attending this workshop/training for
leaders at Victory CDO. It's called Training for Victory (T4V), and it
was a once-a-week engagement for about 10 weeks; although it took longer
than that because of several holidays around that time. We graduated and
were commissioned, not as pastors, but as servants who will lead people
to take on a personal relationship with Christ. By God's grace, I was
also the recipient of the Award for Excellence during the ceremonies.  </p>
<p>All of the learnings I gained during the training has greatly guided me
in my walk with Jesus Christ today. You see, I've constantly struggled
with finding time for prayer, or for studying His Word. I've always had
some reason or excuse to do these at a later time. Eventually, I'd end
up not doing them anymore because work after all, takes a big chunk off
my day; and I have to spend the rest of the day for family and for
resting.  </p>
<p>But the Tuesday sessions brought back a discipline of study that I
thought I've lost. I've realized that just like with office work, or
with project "sprints", I can also discipline myself to do 10-15 minutes
of focused time for prayer, meditation, or Bible study.  </p>
<p>I've greatly benefited from this. Not only have I deepened my
relationship with Christ, but I have also begun to see and feel a change
in myself, in how I perceive prayer and what it can do for me and my
family, and in how I should conduct myself, whether I'm in the company
of others or family. There is no secret formula for this. If you want to
deepen your relationship with God and live a life of victory, let me
know. I'd be more than happy to talk about this with you (over coffee
perhaps?).  </p>
